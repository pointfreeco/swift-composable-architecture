extension ReducerProtocol {
  /// Embeds a child reducer in a parent domain that works on elements of a collection in parent
  /// state.
  ///
  /// For example, if a parent feature holds onto an array of child states, then it can
  /// perform its core logic _and_ the child's logic by using the `forEach` operator:
  ///
  /// ```swift
  /// struct Parent: ReducerProtocol {
  ///   struct State {
  ///     var rows: IdentifiedArrayOf<Row.State>
  ///     // ...
  ///   }
  ///   enum Action {
  ///     case row(id: Row.State.ID, action: Row.Action)
  ///     // ...
  ///   }
  ///
  ///   var body: some ReducerProtocol<State, Action> {
  ///     Reduce { state, action in
  ///       // Core logic for parent feature
  ///     }
  ///     .forEach(\.rows, action: /Action.row) {
  ///       Row()
  ///     }
  ///   }
  /// }
  /// ```
  ///
  /// > Tip: We are using `IdentifiedArray` from our
  /// [Identified Collections][swift-identified-collections] library because it provides a safe and
  /// ergonomic API for accessing elements from a stable ID rather than positional indices.
  ///
  /// The `forEach` forces a specific order of operations for the child and parent features. It runs
  /// the child first, and then the parent. If the order was reversed, then it would be possible for
  /// the parent feature to remove the child state from the array, in which case the child feature
  /// would not be able to react to that action. That can cause subtle bugs.
  ///
  /// It is still possible for a parent feature higher up in the application to remove the child
  /// state from the array before the child has a chance to react to the action. In such cases a
  /// runtime warning is shown in Xcode to let you know that there's a potential problem.

        This is generally considered an application logic error, and can happen for a few reasons:

        • A parent reducer removed an element with this ID before this reducer ran. This reducer \
        must run before any other reducer removes an element, which ensures that element reducers \
        can handle their actions while their state is still available.

        • An in-flight effect emitted this action when state contained no element at this ID. \
        While it may be perfectly reasonable to ignore this action, consider canceling the \
        associated effect before an element is removed, especially if it is a long-living effect.

        • This action was sent to the store while its state contained no element at this ID. To \
        fix this make sure that actions for this reducer can only be sent from a view store when \
        its state contains an element at this id. In SwiftUI applications, use "ForEachStore".
