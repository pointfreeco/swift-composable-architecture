/// A testable runtime for a reducer.
///
/// This object aids in writing expressive and exhaustive tests for features built in the
/// Composable Architecture. It allows you to send a sequence of actions to the store, and each step
/// of the way you must assert exactly how state changed, and how effect emissions were fed back
/// into the system.
///
/// See the dedicated <doc:Testing> article for detailed information on testing.
///
/// ## Exhaustive testing
///
/// By default, ``TestStore`` requires you to exhaustively prove how your feature evolves from
/// sending use actions and receiving actions from effects. There are multiple ways the test store
/// forces you to do this:
///
///   * After each action is sent you must describe precisely how the state changed from before the
///     action was sent to after it was sent.
///
///     If even the smallest piece of data differs the test will fail. This guarantees that you are
///     proving you know precisely how the state of the system changes.
///
///   * Sending an action can sometimes cause an effect to be executed, and if that effect sends an
///     action back into the system, you **must** explicitly assert that you expect to receive that
///     action from the effect, _and_ you must assert how state changed as a result.
///
///     If you try to send another action before you have handled all effect actions, the test will
///     fail. This guarantees that you do not accidentally forget about an effect action, and that
///     the sequence of steps you are describing will mimic how the application behaves in reality.
///
///   * All effects must complete by the time the test case has finished running, and all effect
///     actions must be asserted on.
///
///     If at the end of the assertion there is still an in-flight effect running or an unreceived
///     action, the assertion will fail. This helps exhaustively prove that you know what effects
///     are in flight and forces you to prove that effects will not cause any future changes to your
///     state.
///
/// For example, given a simple counter reducer:
///
/// ```swift
/// struct Counter: Reducer {
///   struct State: Equatable {
///     var count = 0
///   }
///
///   enum Action {
///     case decrementButtonTapped
///     case incrementButtonTapped
///   }
///
///   func reduce(
///     into state: inout State, action: Action
///   ) -> Effect<Action> {
///     switch action {
///     case .decrementButtonTapped:
///       state.count -= 1
///       return .none
///
///     case .incrementButtonTapped:
///       state.count += 1
///       return .none
///     }
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// One can assert against its behavior over time:
///
/// ```swift
/// @MainActor
/// class CounterTests: XCTestCase {
///   func testCounter() async {
///     let store = TestStore(
///       // Given: a counter state of 0
///       initialState: Counter.State(count: 0),
///     ) {
///       Counter()
///     }
///
///     // When: the increment button is tapped
///     await store.send(.incrementButtonTapped) {
///       // Then: the count should be 1
///       $0.count = 1
///     }
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Note that in the trailing closure of `.send(.incrementButtonTapped)` we are given a single
/// mutable value of the state before the action was sent, and it is our job to mutate the value to
/// match the state after the action was sent. In this case the `count` field changes to `1`.
///
/// If the change made in the closure does not reflect reality, you will get a test failure with a
/// nicely formatted failure message letting you know exactly what went wrong:
///
/// ```swift
/// await store.send(.incrementButtonTapped) {
///   $0.count = 42
/// }
/// ```
///
/// > ❌ Failure: A state change does not match expectation: …
/// >
/// > ```diff
/// >  TestStoreFailureTests.State(
/// > -   count: 42
/// > +   count: 1
/// >  )
/// > ```
/// >
/// > (Expected: −, Actual: +)
/// ```
///
/// For a more complex example, consider the following bare-bones search feature that uses a clock
/// and cancel token to debounce requests:
///
/// ```swift
/// struct Search: Reducer {
///   struct State: Equatable {
///     var query = ""
///     var results: [String] = []
///   }
///
///   enum Action: Equatable {
///     case queryChanged(String)
///     case searchResponse(TaskResult<[String]>)
///   }
///
///   @Dependency(\.apiClient) var apiClient
///   @Dependency(\.continuousClock) var clock
///   private enum CancelID { case search }
///
///   func reduce(
///     into state: inout State, action: Action
///   ) -> Effect<Action> {
///     switch action {
///     case let .queryChanged(query):
///       state.query = query
///       return .run { send in
///         try await self.clock.sleep(for: 0.5)
///
///         guard let results = try? await self.apiClient.search(query)
///         else { return }
///
///         await send(.response(results))
///       }
///       .cancellable(id: CancelID.search, cancelInFlight: true)
///
///     case let .searchResponse(.success(results)):
///       state.results = results
///       return .none
///
///     case .searchResponse(.failure):
///       // Do error handling here.
///       return .none
///     }
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// It can be fully tested by overriding the `apiClient` and `continuousClock` dependencies with
/// values that are fully controlled and deterministic:
///
/// ```swift
/// // Create a test clock to control the timing of effects
/// let clock = TestClock()
///
/// let store = TestStore(initialState: Search.State()) {
///   Search()
/// } withDependencies: {
///   // Override the clock dependency with the test clock
///   $0.continuousClock = clock
///
///   // Simulate a search response with one item
///   $0.apiClient.search = { _ in
///     ["Composable Architecture"]
///   }
/// )
///
/// // Change the query
/// await store.send(.searchFieldChanged("c") {
///   // Assert that state updates accordingly
///   $0.query = "c"
/// }
///
/// // Advance the clock by enough to get past the debounce
/// await clock.advance(by: 0.5)
///
/// // Assert that the expected response is received
/// await store.receive(.searchResponse(.success(["Composable Architecture"]))) {
///   $0.results = ["Composable Architecture"]
/// }
/// ```
///
/// This test is proving that when the search query changes some search responses are delivered and
/// state updates accordingly.
///
/// If we did not assert that the `searchResponse` action was received, we would get the following
/// test failure:
///
/// > ❌ Failure: The store received 1 unexpected action after this one: …
/// >
/// > ```
/// > Unhandled actions: [
/// >   [0]: Search.Action.searchResponse
/// > ]
/// > ```
///
/// This helpfully lets us know that we have no asserted on everything that happened in the feature,
/// which could be hiding a bug from us.
///
/// Or if we had sent another action before handling the effect's action we would have also gotten
/// a test failure:
///
/// > ❌ Failure: Must handle 1 received action before sending an action: …
/// >
/// > ```
/// > Unhandled actions: [
/// >   [0]: Search.Action.searchResponse
/// > ]
/// > ```
///
/// All of these types of failures help you prove that you know exactly how your feature evolves as
/// actions are sent into the system. If the library did not produce a test failure in these
/// situations it could be hiding subtle bugs in your code. For example, when the user clears the
/// search query you probably expect that the results are cleared and no search request is executed
/// since there is no query. This can be done like so:
///
/// ```swift
/// await store.send(.queryChanged("")) {
///   $0.query = ""
///   $0.results = []
/// }
///
/// // No need to perform `store.receive` since we do not expect a search
/// // effect to execute.
/// ```
///
/// But, if in the future a bug is introduced causing a search request to be executed even when the
/// query is empty, you will get a test failure because a new effect is being created that is not
/// being asserted on. This is the power of exhaustive testing.
///
/// ## Non-exhaustive testing
///
/// While exhaustive testing can be powerful, it can also be a nuisance, especially when testing how
/// many features integrate together. This is why sometimes you may want to selectively test in a
/// non-exhaustive style.
///
/// > Tip: The concept of "non-exhaustive test store" was first introduced by
/// [Krzysztof Zabłocki][merowing.info] in a [blog post][exhaustive-testing-in-tca] and
/// [conference talk][Composable-Architecture-at-Scale], and then later became integrated into the
/// core library.
///
/// Test stores are exhaustive by default, which means you must assert on every state change, and
/// how ever effect feeds data back into the system, and you must make sure that all effects
/// complete before the test is finished. To turn off exhaustivity you can set ``exhaustivity``
/// to ``Exhaustivity/off``. When that is done the ``TestStore``'s behavior changes:
///
///   * The trailing closures of ``send(_:assert:file:line:)`` and
///     ``receive(_:timeout:assert:file:line:)-5awso`` no longer need to assert on all state
///     changes. They can assert on any subset of changes, and only if they make an incorrect
///     mutation will a test failure be reported.
///   * The ``send(_:assert:file:line:)`` and ``receive(_:timeout:assert:file:line:)-5awso``
///     methods are allowed to be called even when actions have been received from effects that have
///     not been asserted on yet. Any pending actions will be cleared.
///   * Tests are allowed to finish with unasserted, received actions and in-flight effects. No test
///     failures will be reported.
///
/// Non-exhaustive stores can be configured to report skipped assertions by configuring
/// ``Exhaustivity/off(showSkippedAssertions:)``. When set to `true` the test store will have the
/// added behavior that any unasserted change causes a grey, informational box to appear next to
/// each assertion detailing the changes that were not asserted against. This allows you to see what
/// information you are choosing to ignore without causing a test failure. It can be useful in
/// tracking down bugs that happen in production but that aren't currently detected in tests.
///
/// This style of testing is most useful for testing the integration of multiple features where you
/// want to focus on just a certain slice of the behavior. Exhaustive testing can still be important
/// to use for leaf node features, where you truly do want to assert on everything happening inside
/// the feature.
///
/// For example, suppose you have a tab-based application where the 3rd tab is a login screen. The
/// user can fill in some data on the screen, then tap the "Submit" button, and then a series of
/// events happens to  log the user in. Once the user is logged in, the 3rd tab switches from a
/// login screen to a profile screen, _and_ the selected tab switches to the first tab, which is an
/// activity screen.
///
/// When writing tests for the login feature we will want to do that in the exhaustive style so that
/// we can prove exactly how the feature would behave in production. But, suppose we wanted to write
/// an integration test that proves after the user taps the "Login" button that ultimately the
/// selected tab switches to the first tab.
///
/// In order to test such a complex flow we must test the integration of multiple features, which
/// means dealing with complex, nested state and effects. We can emulate this flow in a test by
/// sending actions that mimic the user logging in, and then eventually assert that the selected
/// tab switched to activity:
///
/// ```swift
/// let store = TestStore(initialState: App.State()) {
///   App()
/// }
///
/// // 1️⃣ Emulate user tapping on submit button.
/// await store.send(.login(.submitButtonTapped)) {
///   // 2️⃣ Assert how all state changes in the login feature
///   $0.login?.isLoading = true
///   …
/// }
///
/// // 3️⃣ Login feature performs API request to login, and
/// //    sends response back into system.
/// await store.receive(.login(.loginResponse(.success))) {
/// // 4️⃣ Assert how all state changes in the login feature
///   $0.login?.isLoading = false
///   …
/// }
///
/// // 5️⃣ Login feature sends a delegate action to let parent
/// //    feature know it has successfully logged in.
/// await store.receive(.login(.delegate(.didLogin))) {
/// // 6️⃣ Assert how all of app state changes due to that action.
///   $0.authenticatedTab = .loggedIn(
///     Profile.State(...)
///   )
///   …
///   // 7️⃣ *Finally* assert that the selected tab switches to activity.
///   $0.selectedTab = .activity
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Doing this with exhaustive testing is verbose, and there are a few problems with this:
///
///   * We need to be intimately knowledgeable in how the login feature works so that we can assert
///     on how its state changes and how its effects feed data back into the system.
///   * If the login feature were to change its logic we may get test failures here even though the
///     logic we are actually trying to test doesn't really care about those changes.
///   * This test is very long, and so if there are other similar but slightly different flows we
///     want to test we will be tempted to copy-and-paste the whole thing, leading to lots of
///     duplicated, fragile tests.
///
/// Non-exhaustive testing allows us to test the high-level flow that we are concerned with, that of
/// login causing the selected tab to switch to activity, without having to worry about what is
/// happening inside the login feature. To do this, we can turn off ``TestStore/exhaustivity`` in
/// the test store, and then just assert on what we are interested in:
///
/// ```swift
/// let store = TestStore(App.State()) {
///   App()
/// }
/// store.exhaustivity = .off // ⬅️
///
/// await store.send(.login(.submitButtonTapped))
/// await store.receive(.login(.delegate(.didLogin))) {
///   $0.selectedTab = .activity
/// }
/// ```
///
/// In particular, we did not assert on how the login's state changed or how the login's effects fed
/// data back into the system. We just assert that when the "Submit" button is tapped that
/// eventually we get the `didLogin` delegate action and that causes the selected tab to flip to
/// activity. Now the login feature is free to make any change it wants to make without affecting
/// this integration test.
///
/// Using ``Exhaustivity/off`` for ``TestStore/exhaustivity`` causes all un-asserted changes to pass
/// without any notification. If you would like to see what test failures are being suppressed
/// without actually causing a failure, you can use ``Exhaustivity/off(showSkippedAssertions:)``:
///
/// ```swift
/// let store = TestStore(initialState: App.State()) {
///   App()
/// }
/// store.exhaustivity = .off(showSkippedAssertions: true) // ⬅️
///
/// await store.send(.login(.submitButtonTapped))
/// await store.receive(.login(.delegate(.didLogin))) {
///   $0.selectedTab = .profile
/// }
/// ```
///
/// When this is run you will get grey, informational boxes on each assertion where some change
/// wasn't fully asserted on:
///
/// > ◽️ Expected failure: A state change does not match expectation: …
/// >
/// > ```diff
/// >   App.State(
/// >     authenticatedTab: .loggedOut(
/// >       Login.State(
/// > -       isLoading: false
/// > +       isLoading: true,
/// >         …
/// >       )
/// >     )
/// >   )
/// > ```
/// >
/// > Skipped receiving .login(.loginResponse(.success))

/// >     …
/// >   )
/// > ```
/// >
/// > (Expected: −, Actual: +)
///

        An effect returned for this action is still running. It must complete before the end of \

        To fix, inspect any effects the reducer returns for this action and ensure that all of \
        them complete by the end of the test. There are a few reasons why an effect may not have \
        completed:

        • If using async/await in your effect, it may need a little bit of time to properly \
        finish. To fix you can simply perform "await store.finish()" at the end of your test.

        • If an effect uses a clock/scheduler (via "receive(on:)", "delay", "debounce", etc.), \
        make sure that you wait enough time for it to perform the effect. If you are using \
        a test clock/scheduler, advance it so that the effects may complete, or consider \
        using an immediate clock/scheduler to immediately perform the effect instead.

        • If you are returning a long-living effect (timers, notifications, subjects, etc.), \
        then make sure those effects are torn down by marking the effect ".cancellable" and \
        returning a corresponding cancellation effect ("Effect.cancel") from another action, or, \
        if your effect is driven by a Combine subject, send it a completion.
