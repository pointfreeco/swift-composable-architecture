import SwiftUI

/// A data type that describes the state of an alert that can be shown to the user. The `Action`
/// generic is the type of actions that can be sent from tapping on a button in the alert.
///
/// This type can be used in your application's state in order to control the presentation or
/// dismissal of alerts. It is preferrable to use this API instead of the default SwiftUI API
/// for alerts because SwiftUI uses 2-way bindings in order to control the showing and dismissal
/// of alerts, and that does not play nicely with the Composable Architecture. The library requires
/// that all state mutations happen by sending an action so that a reducer can handle that logic,
/// which greatly simplifies how data flows through your application, and gives you instant
/// testability on all parts of your application.
///
/// To use this API, you model all the alert actions in your domain's action enum:
///
///     enum AppAction: Equatable {
///       case cancelTapped
///       case confirmTapped
///       case deleteTapped
///
///       // Your other actions
///     }
///
/// And you model the state for showing the alert in your domain's state, and it can start off
/// `nil`:
///
///     struct AppState: Equatable {
///       var alert = AlertState<AppAction>?
///
///       // Your other state
///     }
///
/// Then, in the reducer you can construct an `AlertState` value to represent the alert you want
/// to show to the user:
///
///     let appReducer = Reducer<AppState, AppAction, AppEnvironment> { state, action, env in
///       switch action
///         case .cancelTapped:
///           state.alert = nil
///           return .none
///
///         case .confirmTapped:
///           state.alert = nil
///           // Do deletion logic...
///
///         case .deleteTapped:
///           state.alert = .init(
///             title: "Delete",
///             message: "Are you sure you want to delete this? It cannot be undone.",
///             primaryButton: .default("Confirm", send: .confirmTapped),
///             secondaryButton: .cancel()
///           )
///         return .none
///       }
///     }
///
/// And then, in your view you can use the `.alert(_:send:dismiss:)` method on `View` in order
/// to present the alert in a way that works best with the Composable Architecture:
///
///     Button("Delete") { viewStore.send(.deleteTapped) }
///       .alert(
///         viewStore.scope(state: \.alert),
///         dismiss: .cancelTapped
///       )
///
/// This makes your reducer in complete control of when the alert is shown or dismissed, and makes
/// it so that any choice made in the alert is automatically fed back into the reducer so that you
/// can handle its logic.
///
/// Even better, you can instantly write tests that your alert behavior works as expected:
///
///     let store = TestStore(
///       initialState: AppState(),
///       reducer: appReducer,
///       environment: .mock
///     )
///
///     store.assert(
///       .send(.deleteTapped) {
///         $0.alert = .init(
///           title: "Delete",
///           message: "Are you sure you want to delete this? It cannot be undone.",
///           primaryButton: .default("Confirm", send: .confirmTapped),
///           secondaryButton: .cancel(send: .cancelTapped)
///         )
///       },
///       .send(.deleteTapped) {
///         $0.alert = nil
///         // Also verify that delete logic executed correctly
///       }
///     )
///
