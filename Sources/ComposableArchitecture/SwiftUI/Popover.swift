  ///   - attachmentAnchor: The positioning anchor that defines the attachment point of the popover.
  ///   - arrowEdge: The edge of the `attachmentAnchor` that defines the location of the popover's
  ///     arrow in macOS. iOS ignores this parameter.
  ///   - content: A closure returning the content of the popover.
