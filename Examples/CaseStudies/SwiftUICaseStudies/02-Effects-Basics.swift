  This screen demonstrates how to introduce side effects into a feature built with the \
  Composable Architecture.

  A side effect is a unit of work that needs to be performed in the outside world. For example, an \
  API request needs to reach an external service over HTTP, which brings with it lots of \
  uncertainty and complexity.

  Many things we do in our applications involve side effects, such as timers, database requests, \
  file access, socket connections, and anytime a scheduler is involved (such as debouncing, \
  throttling and delaying), and they are typically difficult to test.

  This application has a simple side effect: tapping "Number fact" will trigger an API request to \
  load a piece of trivia about that number. This effect is handled by the reducer, and a full test \
  suite is written to confirm that the effect behaves in the way we expect.
