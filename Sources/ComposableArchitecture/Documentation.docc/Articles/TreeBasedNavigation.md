# Tree-based navigation

Learn about tree-based navigation, that is navigation modeled with optionals and enums, including
how to model your domains, how to integrate features, how to test your features, and more.

## Overview

Tree-based navigation is the process of modeling navigation using optional and enum state. This 
style of navigation allows you to deep-link into any state of your application by simply 
constructing a deeply nested piece of state, handing it off to SwiftUI, and letting it take care of
the rest.

## Basics

The tools for this style of navigation include the ``PresentationState`` property wrapper,
``PresentationAction``, the ``ReducerProtocol/ifLet(_:action:then:fileID:line:)`` operator, and a
whole host of other APIs that mimic SwiftUI's regular tools, but tuned specifically for the
Composable Architecture.

The process of integrating two features together for navigation largely consists of 2 steps:
integrating the features' domains together and integrating the features' views together. One
typically starts by integrating the features' domains together. This consists of adding the child's
state and actions to the parent, and then utilizing a reducer operator to compose the child reducer
into the parent.

For example, suppose you have a list of items and you want to be able to show a sheet to display a
form for adding a new item. We can integrate state and actions together by utilizing the 
``PresentationState`` and ``PresentationAction`` types:

```swift
struct InventoryFeature: ReducerProtocol {
  struct State: Equatable {
    @PresentationState var addItem: ItemFormFeature.State?
    var items: IdentifiedArrayOf<Item> = []
    // ...
  }

  enum Action: Equatable {
    case addItem(PresentationAction<ItemFormFeature.Action>)
    // ...
  }

  // ...
}
``` 

> Note: The `addItem` state is held as an optional. A non-`nil` value represents that feature is
> being presented, and `nil` presents the feature is dismissed.

Next you can integrate the reducers of the parent and child features by using the 
``ReducerProtocol/ifLet(_:action:then:fileID:line:)`` reducer operator, as well as having an action
in the parent domain for populating the child's state to drive navigation:

```swift
struct InventoryFeature: ReducerProtocol {
  struct State: Equatable { /* ... */ }
  enum Action: Equatable { /* ... */ }
  
  var body: some ReducerProtocolOf<Self> {
    Reduce<State, Action> { state, action in 
      switch action {
      case .addButtonTapped:
        // Populating this state performs the navigation
        state.addItem = ItemFormFeature.State()
        return .none

      // ...
      }
    }
    .ifLet(\.$addItem, action: /Action.addItem) {
      ItemFormFeature()
    }
  }
}
```

> Note: The key path used with `ifLet` focuses on the `@PresentationState` projected value since it 
> uses the `$` syntax. Also note that the action uses a
> [case path](http://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-case-paths), which is analogous to key paths but
> tuned for enums, and uses the forward slash syntax.

That's all that it takes to integrate the domains and logic of the parent and child features. Next
we need to integrate the features' views. This is done using view modifiers that look similar to
SwiftUI's, but are tuned specifically to work with the Composable Architecture.

For example, to show a sheet from the `addItem` state in the `InventoryFeature`, we can use
the `sheet(store:)` modifier that takes a ``Store`` as an argument that is focused on presentation
state and actions:

```swift
struct InventoryView: View {
  let store: StoreOf<InventoryFeature>

  var body: some View {
    List {
      // ...
    }
    .sheet(
      store: self.store.scope(state: \.$addItem, action: { .addItem($0) })
    ) { store in
      ItemFormView(store: store)
    }
  }
}
```

Note that we again specify a key path to the presentation state property wrapper, _i.e._
`\.$addItem`.

With those few steps completed the domains and views of the parent and child features are now
integrated together, and when the `addItem` state flips to a non-`nil` value the sheet will be
presented, and when it is `nil`'d out it will be dismissed.

The library ships with overloads for all of SwiftUI's styles of navigation that take stores of 
presentation domain, including:

  * `alert(store:)`
  * `confirmationDialog(store:)`
  * `sheet(store:)`
  * `popover(store:)`
  * `fullScreenCover(store:)`
  * `navigationDestination(store:)`
  * ``NavigationLinkStore``

This should make it possible to use optional state to drive any kind of navigation in a SwiftUI
application.

## Enum state

While driving navigation with optional state can be powerful, it can also lead to less-than-ideal
modeled domains. In particular, if a feature can navigate to multiple screens then you may be 
tempted to model that with multiple optional values:

```swift
struct State {
  @PresentationState var detailItem: DetailFeature.State?
  @PresentationState var editItem: EditFeature.State?
  @PresentationState var addItem: AddFeature.State?
  // ...
}
```

However, this can lead to invalid states, such as 2 or more states being non-nil at the same time,
and that can cause a lot of problems. First of all, SwiftUI does not support presenting multiple 
views at the same time from a single view, and so by allowing this in our state we run the risk of 
putting our application into an inconsistent state with respect to SwiftUI.

Second, it becomes more difficult for us to determine what feature is actually being presented. We
must check multiple optionals to figure out which one is non-`nil`, and then we must figure out how
to interpret when multiple pieces of state are non-`nil` at the same time.

And the number of invalid states increases exponentially with respect to the number of features that
can be navigated to. For example, 3 optionals leads to 4 invalid states, 4 optionals leads to 11
invalid states, and 5 optionals leads to 26 invalid states.

For these reasons, and more, it can be better to model multiple destinations in a feature as a
single enum rather than multiple optionals. So the example of above, with 3 optionals, can be
refactored as an enum:

```swift
enum State {
  case addItem(AddFeature.State)
  case detailItem(DetailFeature.State)
  case editItem(EditFeature.State)
  // ...
}
```

This gives us compile-time proof that only one single destination can be active at a time.

In order to utilize this style of domain modeling you must take a few extra steps. First you model a
"destination" reducer that encapsulates the domains and behavior of all of the features that you can
navigate to. And typically it's best to nest this reducer inside the feature that can perform the
navigation:

```swift
struct InventoryFeature: ReducerProtocol {
  // ...

  struct Destination: ReducerProtocol {
    enum State {
      case addItem(AddFeature.State)
      case detailItem(DetailFeature.State)
      case editItem(EditFeature.State)
    }
    enum Action {
      case addItem(AddFeature.Action)
      case detailItem(DetailFeature.Action)
      case editItem(EditFeature.Action)
    }
    var body: some ReducerProtocolOf<Self> {
      Scope(state: /State.addItem, action: /Action.addItem) { 
        AddFeature()
      }
      Scope(state: /State.editItem, action: /Action.editItem) { 
        EditFeature()
      }
      Scope(state: /State.detailItem, action: /Action.detailItem) { 
        DetailFeature()
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> Note: Both the `State` and `Action` types nested in the reducer are enums, with a case for each
> screen that can be navigated to. Further, the `body` computed property has a ``Scope`` reducer for
> each feature, and uses case paths for focusing in on the specific case of the state and action
> enums.

With that done we can now hold onto a _single_ piece of optional state in our feature, using the
``PresentationState`` property wrapper, and we hold onto the destination actions using the
``PresentationAction`` type:

```swift
struct InventoryFeature: ReducerProtocol {
  struct State { 
    @PresentationState var destination: Destination.State?
    // ...
  }
  enum Action {
    case destination(PresentationAction<Destination.Action>)
    // ...
  }

  // ...
}
```

Now when we want to present a particular feature we can simply populate the `destination` state
with a case of the enum:

```swift
case addButtonTapped:
  state.destination = .addItem(AddFeature.State())
  return .none
```

And at any time we can figure out exactly what feature is being presented by switching or otherwise
destructuring the single piece of `destination` state rather than checking multiple optional values.

The final step is to make use of the special view modifiers that come with this library that mimic
SwiftUI's APIs, but are tuned specifically for enum state. In particular, you provide a store that
is focused in on the `Destination` domain, and then provide transformations for isolating a
particular case of the state and action enums.

For example, suppose the "add" screen is presented as a sheet, the "edit" screen is presented 
by a popover, and the "detail" screen is presented in a drill-down. Then we can use the 
`.sheet(store:state:action:)`, `.popover(store:state:action:)`, and 
`.navigationDestination(store:state:action:)` view modifiers to have each of those styles of 
presentation powered by the respective case of the destination enum:

```swift
struct InventoryView: View {
  let store: StoreOf<InventoryFeature>

  var body: some View {
    List {
      // ...
    }
    .sheet(
      store: self.store.scope(state: \.destination, action: { .destination($0) }),
      state: /InventoryFeature.State.addItem,
      action: /InventoryFeature.Action.addItem
    ) { store in 
      AddFeatureView(store: store)
    }
    .popover(
      store: self.store.scope(state: \.destination, action: { .destination($0) }),
      state: /InventoryFeature.State.editItem,
      action: /InventoryFeature.Action.editItem
    ) { store in 
      EditFeatureView(store: store)
    }
    .navigationDestination(
      store: self.store.scope(state: \.destination, action: { .destination($0) }),
      state: /InventoryFeature.State.detailItem,
      action: /InventoryFeature.Action.detailItem
    ) { store in 
      DetailFeatureView(store: store)
    }
  }
}
```

With those steps completed you can be sure that your domains are modeled as concisely as possible.
If the "add" item sheet was presented, and you decided to mutate the `destination` state to point
to the `.detailItem` case, then you can be certain that the sheet will be dismissed and the 
drill-down will occur immediately.

## Integration

Once your features are integrated together using the steps above, your parent feature gets instant
access to everything happening inside the child feature. You can use this as a means to integrate
the logic of child and parent features. For example, if you want to detect when the "Save" button
inside the edit feature is tapped, you can simply destructure on that action. This consists of
pattern matching on the ``PresentationAction``, then the ``PresentationAction/presented(_:)`` case,
then the feature you are interested in, and finally the action you are interested in:

```swift
case .destination(.presented(.editItem(.saveButtonTapped))):
  // ...
```

Once inside that case you can then try extracting out the feature state so that you can perform
additional logic, such as closing the "edit" feature and saving the edited item to the database:

```swift
case .destination(.presented(.editItem(.saveButtonTapped))):
  guard case let .editItem(editItemState) = self.destination
  else { return .none }

  state.destination = nil
  return .fireAndForget {
    self.database.save(editItemState.item)
  }
```

## Dismissal

Dismissing a presented feature is as simple as `nil`-ing out the state that represents the 
presented feature:

```swift
case .closeButtonTapped:
  state.destination = nil
  return .none
```

In order to `nil` out the presenting state you must have access to that state, and usually only the
parent has access, but often we would like to encapsulate the logic of dismissing a feature to be
inside the child feature without needing explicit communication with the parent.

SwiftUI provides a wonderful tool for allowing child _views_ to dismiss themselves from the parent,
all without any explicit communication with the parent. It's an environment value called `dismiss`,
and it can be used like so:

```swift
struct ChildView: View {
  @Environment(\.dismiss) var dismiss
  var body: some View {
    Button("Close") {
      self.dismiss()
    }
  }
}
```

When `self.dismiss()` is invoked, SwiftUI finds the closet parent view with a presentation, and
causes it to dismiss. This can be incredibly useful, but it is also relegated to the view layer. It
is not possible to use `dismiss` elsewhere, like in an observable object.

The Composable Architecture has a similar tool, except it is appropriate to use from a reducer,
where the rest of your feature's logic and behavior resides. It is accessed via the library's
dependency management system (see <doc:DependencyManagement>) using ``DismissEffect``:

```swift
struct Feature: ReducerProtocol {
  struct State { /* ... */ }
  enum Action { 
    case closeButtonTapped
    // ...
  }
  @Dependency(\.dismiss) var dismiss
  func reduce(into state: inout State, action: Action) -> EffectTask<Action> {
    switch action {
    case .closeButtonTapped:
      return .fireAndForget { await self.dismiss() }
    } 
  }
}
```

> Note: The ``DismissEffect`` function is async which means it cannot be invoked directly inside a 
> reducer. Instead it must be called from either 
> ``EffectPublisher/run(priority:operation:catch:fileID:line:)`` or
> ``EffectPublisher/fireAndForget(priority:_:)``.

When `self.dismiss()` is invoked it will `nil` out the state responsible for presenting the feature,
causing the feature to be dismissed. This allows you to encapsulate the logic for dismissing a child 
feature entirely inside the child domain without explicitly communicating with the parent.

> Warning: SwiftUI's environment value `@Environment(\.dismiss)` and the Composable Architecture's
> dependency value `@Dependency(\.dismiss)` serve similar purposes, but are completely different 
> types. SwiftUI's environment value can only be used in SwiftUI views, and this library's
> dependency value can only be used inside reducers.

## Testing

A huge benefit of properly modeling your domains for navigation is that testing because quite easy.
Further, using "non-exhaustive testing" (see <doc:Testing#Non-exhaustive-testing>) can be very 
useful for testing navigation since you often only want to assert on a few high level details and 
not all state mutations and effects.

As an example, consider the following simple counter feature that wants to dismiss itself if its
count is greater than or equal to 5:

```swift
struct CounterFeature: ReducerProtocol {
  struct State: Equatable {
    var count = 0
  }
  enum Action: Equatable {
    case decrementButtonTapped
    case incrementButtonTapped
  }

  @Dependency(\.dismiss) var dismiss

  func reduce(into state: inout State, action: Action) -> EffectTask<Action> {
    switch action {
    case .decrementButtonTapped:
      state.count += 1
      return .none

    case .incrementButtonTapped:
      state.count += 1
      return state.count >= 5
        ? .fireAndForget { await self.dismiss() }
        : .none
    }
  }
}
```

And then let's embed that feature into a parent feature:

```swift
struct Feature: ReducerProtocol {
  struct State: Equatable {
    @PresentationState var counter: CounterFeature.State?
  }
  enum Action: Equatable {
    case counter(CounterFeature.Action)
  }
  var body: some ReducerProtocolOf<Self> {
    Reduce { state, action in 
      // ...
    }
    .ifLet(\.$counter, action: /Action.counter) {
      CounterFeature()
    }
  }
}
```

Typically this feature reducer would have a lot more logic.

Now let's try to write a test on the `Feature` reducer that proves that when the child counter 
feature's count is incremented above 5 it will dismiss itself. To do this we will construct a 
``TestStore`` for `Feature` that starts in a state with the count already set to 3:

```swift
func testDismissal() {
  let store = TestStore(
    initialState: Feature.State(
      counter: CounterFeature.State(count: 3)
    ),
    reducer: CounterFeature()
  )
}
```

Then we can send the `.incrementButtonTapped` action in the counter child feature to confirm
that the count goes up by one:

```swift
await store.send(.counter(.presented(.incrementButtonTapped))) {
  $0.counter?.count = 4
}
```

And then we can send it one more time to see that the count goes up to 5:

```swift 
await store.send(.counter(.presented(.incrementButtonTapped))) {
  $0.counter?.count = 5
}
```

And then we finally expect that the child dismisses itself, which manifests itself as the 
``PresentationAction/dismiss`` action being sent and `nil`ing out the `counter` state:

```swift
await store.receive(.counter(.dismiss)) {
  $0.counter = nil
}
```

This shows how we can write very nuanced tests on how parent and child features interact with each
other.

However, the more complex the features become, the more cumbersome testing their integration can be.
By default, ``TestStore`` requires us to be exhaustive in our assertions. We must assert on how
every piece of state changes, how every effect feeds data back into the system, and we must make
sure that all effects finish by the end of the test (see <docs:Testing> for more info).

But ``TestStore`` also supports a form of testing known as "non-exhaustive testing" that allows you
to assert on only the parts of the features that you actually care about (see 
<doc:Testing#Non-exhaustive-testing> for more info).

For example, if we turn off exhaustivity on the test store (see ``TestStore/exhaustivity``) then we
can assert at a high level that when the increment button is tapped twice that eventually we receive
a dismiss action:

```swift
func testDismissal() {
  let store = TestStore(
    initialState: Feature.State(
      counter: CounterFeature.State(count: 3)
    ),
    reducer: CounterFeature()
  )
  store.exhaustivity = .off

  await store.send(.counter(.presented(.incrementButtonTapped)))
  await store.send(.counter(.presented(.incrementButtonTapped)))
  await store.receive(.counter(.dismiss)) 
}
```

This essentially proves the same thing that the previous test proves, but it does so in much fewer
lines and is more resilient to future changes in the features that we don't necessarily care about.
