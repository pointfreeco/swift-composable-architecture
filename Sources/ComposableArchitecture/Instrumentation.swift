/// Interface to enable tracking/instrumenting the activity within TCA as ``Actions`` are sent into ``Store``s and
/// ``ViewStores``, ``Reducers`` are executed, and ``Effects`` are observed.
///
/// Additionally it can also track where `ViewStore` / `Store` instances's are created.
///
/// The way the library will call the closures provided is identical to the way that the ``Actions`` and ``Effects`` are
/// handled internally. That means that there are likely to be ``Instrumentation.ViewStore`` `will|did` pairs contained
/// within the bounds of an ``Instrumentation.Store`` `will|did` pair. For example: Consider sending a simple ``Action``
/// into a ``ViewStore`` that does not produce any synchronous ``Effects`` from the ``Reducer``, and the ``ViewStore``
/// scoped off a parent ``Store``s state:
/// ```
/// ViewStore.send(.someAction)
/// .pre, .viewStoreSend
///   Store.send(.someAction)
///   .pre, .storeSend
///     The Store will begin processing .someAction
///     .pre, .storeProcessEvent
///       The Store's reducer handles .someAction
///       Any returned actions from the reducer are queued up
///     .post, .storeProcessEvent
///     The above(willProcess -> didProcess) is repeated for each queued up action within Store
///     .pre, .storeChangeState
///       The Store updates its state
///       For each child Store scoped off the Store using a scoped local state
///         The Store computes the scoped local state
///         .pre, .scopedStoreToLocal
///         .post, .scopedStoreToLocal
///         The Store determines if the scoped local state is has changed
///         .pre, .scopedStoreDeduplicate
///         .post, .scopedtoreDeduplicate
///         If the scoped local state has changed then the scoped child Store's state is updated, along with any further
///         downstream scoped Stores
///         .pre, .scopedStoreChangeState
///         .post, .scopedStoreChangeState
///       For each ViewStore subscribed to a Store, if the state has changed will have their states updated at this too,
///       thus there may be multiple instances of the below
///         .pre, .viewStoreDeduplicate for impacted ViewStores
///         The existing state of the ViewStore instance is compared newly generated state and determined if it is a duplicate (this is unique to our branch of TCA)
///         .post, .viewStoreDeduplicate
///         .pre, .viewStoreChangeState
///         If the value for a ViewStores state was not a duplicate, then it is updated
///         .post, .viewStoreChangeState
///     .post, .storeChangeState
///   .post, .store.didSend
/// .post, .viewStoreSend
