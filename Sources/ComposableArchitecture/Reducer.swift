            * The reducer for a particular case of state was combined with or run from another \

            run case-specific reducers before reducers that may set their state to another case. \
            This ensures that case-specific reducers can handle their actions while their state \
            is available.

            * An in-flight effect emitted this action when state was unavailable. While it may \
            be perfectly reasonable to ignore this action, you may want to cancel the associated \
            effect before state is set to another case, especially if it is a long-living effect.

            * This action was sent to the store while state was another case. Make sure that \
            actions for this reducer can only be sent to a view store when state is non-"nil".
