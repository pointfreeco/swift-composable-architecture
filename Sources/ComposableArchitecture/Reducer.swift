/// A protocol that describes how to evolve the current state of an application to the next state,
/// given an action, and describes what ``Effect``s should be executed later by the store, if any.
///
/// Conform types to this protocol to represent the domain, logic and behavior for your feature.
/// The domain is specified by the "state" and "actions", which can be nested types inside the
/// conformance:
///
/// ```swift
/// struct Feature: Reducer {
///   struct State {
///     var count = 0
///   }
///   enum Action {
///     case decrementButtonTapped
///     case incrementButtonTapped
///   }
///
///   // ...
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The logic of your feature is implemented by mutating the feature's current state when an action
/// comes into the system. This is most easily done by implementing the
/// ``Reducer/reduce(into:action:)-1t2ri`` method of the protocol.
///
/// ```swift
/// struct Feature: Reducer {
///   // ...
///
///   func reduce(into state: inout State, action: Action) -> Effect<Action> {
///     switch action {
///     case .decrementButtonTapped:
///       state.count -= 1
///       return .none
///
///     case .incrementButtonTapped:
///       state.count += 1
///       return .none
///     }
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The `reduce` method's first responsibility is to mutate the feature's current state given an
/// action. Its second responsibility is to return effects that will be executed asynchronously
/// and feed their data back into the system. Currently `Feature` does not need to run any effects,
/// and so ``Effect/none`` is returned.
///
/// If the feature does need to do effectful work, then more would need to be done. For example,
/// suppose the feature has the ability to start and stop a timer, and with each tick of the timer
/// the `count` will be incremented. That could be done like so:
///
/// ```swift
/// struct Feature: Reducer {
///   struct State {
///     var count = 0
///   }
///   enum Action {
///     case decrementButtonTapped
///     case incrementButtonTapped
///     case startTimerButtonTapped
///     case stopTimerButtonTapped
///     case timerTick
///   }
///   enum CancelID { case timer }
///
///   func reduce(into state: inout State, action: Action) -> Effect<Action> {
///     switch action {
///     case .decrementButtonTapped:
///       state.count -= 1
///       return .none
///
///     case .incrementButtonTapped:
///       state.count += 1
///       return .none
///
///     case .startTimerButtonTapped:
///       return .run { send in
///         while true {
///           try await Task.sleep(for: .seconds(1))
///           await send(.timerTick)
///         }
///       }
///       .cancellable(CancelID.timer)
///
///     case .stopTimerButtonTapped:
///       return .cancel(CancelID.timer)
///
///     case .timerTick:
///       state.count += 1
///       return .none
///     }
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// > Note: This sample emulates a timer by performing an infinite loop with a `Task.sleep`
/// inside. This is simple to do, but is also inaccurate since small imprecisions can accumulate.
/// It would be better to inject a clock into the feature so that you could use its `timer`
/// method. Read the <doc:DependencyManagement> and <doc:Testing> articles for more
/// information.
///
/// That is the basics of implementing a feature as a conformance to ``Reducer``. There are
/// actually two ways to define a reducer:
///
///   1. You can either implement the ``reduce(into:action:)-1t2ri`` method, as shown above, which
///   is given direct mutable access to application ``State`` whenever an ``Action`` is fed into
///   the system, and returns an ``Effect`` that can communicate with the outside world and
///   feed additional ``Action``s back into the system.
///
///   2. Or you can implement the ``body-swift.property`` property, which combines one or
///   more reducers together.
///
/// At most one of these requirements should be implemented. If a conformance implements both
/// requirements, only ``reduce(into:action:)-1t2ri`` will be called by the ``Store``. If your
/// reducer assembles a body from other reducers _and_ has additional business logic it needs to
/// layer onto the feature, introduce this logic into the body instead, either with ``Reduce``:
///
/// ```swift
/// var body: some Reducer<State, Action> {
///   Reduce { state, action in
///     // extra logic
///   }
///   Activity()
///   Profile()
///   Settings()
/// }
/// ```
///
/// …or moving the extra logic to a method that is wrapped in ``Reduce``:
///
/// ```swift
/// var body: some Reducer<State, Action> {
///   Reduce(self.core)
///   Activity()
///   Profile()
///   Settings()
/// }
///
/// func core(state: inout State, action: Action) -> Effect<Action> {
///   // extra logic
/// }
/// ```
///
/// If you are implementing a custom reducer operator that transforms an existing reducer, _always_
/// invoke the ``reduce(into:action:)-1t2ri`` method, never the ``body-swift.property``. For
/// example, this operator that logs all actions sent to the reducer:
///
/// ```swift
/// extension Reducer {
///   func logActions() -> some Reducer<State, Action> {
///     Reduce { state, action in
///       print("Received action: \(action)")
///       return self.reduce(into: &state, action: action)
///     }
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///

  associatedtype State

  /// A type that holds all possible actions that cause the ``State`` of the reducer to change
  /// and/or kick off a side ``Effect`` that can communicate with the outside world.
