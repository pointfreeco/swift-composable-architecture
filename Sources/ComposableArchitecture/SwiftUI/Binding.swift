import CasePaths
import SwiftUI

/// An action that describes simple mutations to some root state at a writable key path.
///
/// This type can be used to eliminate the boilerplate that is typically incurred when working with
/// multiple mutable fields on state.
///
/// For example, a settings screen may model its state with the following struct:
///
/// ```swift
/// struct SettingsState {
///   var digest = Digest.daily
///   var displayName = ""
///   var enableNotifications = false
///   var protectMyPosts = false
///   var sendEmailNotifications = false
///   var sendMobileNotifications = false
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Each of these fields should be editable, and in the Composable Architecture this means that each
/// field requires a corresponding action that can be sent to the store. Typically this comes in the
/// form of an enum with a case per field:
///
/// ```swift
/// enum SettingsAction {
///   case digestChanged(Digest)
///   case displayNameChanged(String)
///   case enableNotificationsChanged(Bool)
///   case protectMyPostsChanged(Bool)
///   case sendEmailNotificationsChanged(Bool)
///   case sendMobileNotificationsChanged(Bool)
/// }
/// ```
///
/// And we're not even done yet. In the reducer we must now handle each action, which simply
/// replaces the state at each field with a new value:
///
/// ```swift
/// let settingsReducer = Reducer<
///   SettingsState, SettingsAction, SettingsEnvironment
/// > { state, action, environment in
///   switch action {
///   case let digestChanged(digest):
///     state.digest = digest
///     return .none
///
///   case let displayNameChanged(displayName):
///     state.displayName = displayName
///     return .none
///
///   case let enableNotificationsChanged(isOn):
///     state.enableNotifications = isOn
///     return .none
///
///   case let protectMyPostsChanged(isOn):
///     state.protectMyPosts = isOn
///     return .none
///
///   case let sendEmailNotificationsChanged(isOn):
///     state.sendEmailNotifications = isOn
///     return .none
///
///   case let sendMobileNotificationsChanged(isOn):
///     state.sendMobileNotifications = isOn
///     return .none
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// This is a _lot_ of boilerplate for something that should be simple. Luckily, we can dramatically
/// eliminate this boilerplate using ``BindingAction``. First, we can collapse all of these
/// field-mutating actions into a single case that holds a ``BindingAction`` generic over the
/// reducer's root `SettingsState`:
///
/// ```swift
/// enum SettingsAction {
///   case binding(BindingAction<SettingsState>)
/// }
/// ```
///
/// And then, we can simplify the settings reducer by allowing the `binding` method to handle these
/// field mutations for us:
///
/// ```swift
/// let settingsReducer = Reducer<
///   SettingsState, SettingsAction, SettingsEnvironment
/// > {
///   switch action {
///   case .binding:
///     return .none
///   }
/// }
/// .binding(action: /SettingsAction.binding)
/// ```
///
/// Binding actions are constructed and sent to the store by providing a writable key path from root
/// state to the field being mutated. There is even a view store helper that simplifies this work.
/// You can derive a binding by specifying the key path and binding action case:
///
/// ```swift
/// TextField(
///   "Display name",
///   text: viewStore.binding(keyPath: \.displayName, send: SettingsAction.binding)
/// )
/// ```
///
/// Should you need to layer additional functionality over these bindings, your reducer can pattern
/// match the action for a given key path:
///
/// ```swift
/// case .binding(\.displayName):
///   // Validate display name
///
/// case .binding(\.enableNotifications):
///   // Return an authorization request effect
/// ```
///
/// Binding actions can also be tested in much the same way regular actions are tested. Rather than
/// send a specific action describing how a binding changed, such as `displayNameChanged("Blob")`,
/// you will send a ``Reducer/binding(action:)`` action that describes which key path is being set
/// to what value, such as `.binding(.set(\.displayName, "Blob"))`:
///
/// ```swift
/// let store = TestStore(
///   initialState: SettingsState(),
///   reducer: settingsReducer,
///   environment: SettingsEnvironment(...)
/// )
///
/// store.send(.binding(.set(\.displayName, "Blob"))) {
///   $0.displayName = "Blob"
/// }
/// store.send(.binding(.set(\.protectMyPosts, true))) {
///   $0.protectMyPosts = true
/// )
/// ```
