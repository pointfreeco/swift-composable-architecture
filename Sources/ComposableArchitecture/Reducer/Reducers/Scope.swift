/// Embeds a child reducer in a parent domain.
///
/// ``Scope`` allows you to transform a parent domain into a child domain, and then run a child
/// reduce on that subset domain. This is an important tool for breaking down large features into
/// smaller units and then piecing them together. The smaller units can easier to understand and
/// test, and can even be packaged into their own isolated modules.
///
/// You hand ``Scope`` 3 pieces of data for it to do its job:
///
/// * A writable key path that identifies the child state inside the parent state.
/// * A case path that identifies the child actions inside the parent actions.
/// * A @``ReducerBuilder`` closure that describes the reducer you want to run on the child domain.
///
/// When run, it will intercept all child actions sent and feed them to the child reducer so that
/// it can update the parent state and execute effects.
///
/// For example, given the basic scaffolding of child reducer:
///
/// ```swift
/// struct Child: Reducer {
///   struct State {
///     // ...
///   }
///   enum Action {
///     // ...
///   }
///   // ...
/// }
/// ```
///
/// A parent reducer with a domain that holds onto the child domain can use
/// ``init(state:action:child:)`` to embed the child reducer in its ``Reducer/body-swift.property``:
///
/// ```swift
/// struct Parent: Reducer {
///   struct State {
///     var child: Child.State
///     // ...
///   }
///
///   enum Action {
///     case child(Child.Action)
///     // ...
///   }
///
///   var body: some Reducer<State, Action> {
///     Scope(state: \.child, action: /Action.child) {
///       Child()
///     }
///     Reduce { state, action in
///       // Additional parent logic and behavior
///     }
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Enum state
///
/// The ``Scope`` reducer also works when state is modeled as an enum, not just a struct. In that
/// case you can use ``init(state:action:child:fileID:line:)`` to specify a case path that
/// identifies the case of state you want to scope to.
///
/// For example, if your state was modeled as an enum for unloaded/loading/loaded, you could
/// scope to the loaded case to run a reduce on only that case:
///
/// ```swift
/// struct Feature: Reducer {
///   enum State {
///     case unloaded
///     case loading
///     case loaded(Child.State)
///   }
///   enum Action {
///     case child(Child.Action)
///     // ...
///   }
///
///   var body: some Reducer<State, Action> {
///     Scope(state: /State.loaded, action: /Action.child) {
///       Child()
///     }
///     Reduce { state, action in
///       // Additional feature logic and behavior
///     }
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// It is important to note that the order of combine ``Scope`` and your additional feature logic
/// matters. It must be combined before the additional logic. In the other order it would be
/// possible for the feature to intercept a child action, switch the state to another case, and
/// then the scoped child reducer would not be able to react to that action. That can cause subtle
/// bugs, and so we show a runtime warning in that case, and cause test failures.
///
/// For an alternative to using ``Scope`` with state case paths that enforces the order, check out
/// the ``ifCaseLet(_:action:then:fileID:line:)`` operator.

          This is generally considered an application logic error, and can happen for a few \
          reasons:

          • A parent reducer set "\(typeName(ParentState.self))" to a different case before the \
          scoped reducer ran. Child reducers must run before any parent reducer sets child state \
          to a different case. This ensures that child reducers can handle their actions while \
          their state is still available. Consider using "Reducer.ifCaseLet" to embed this \
          child reducer in the parent reducer that change its state to ensure the child reducer \
          runs first.

          • An in-flight effect emitted this action when child state was unavailable. While it may \
          be perfectly reasonable to ignore this action, consider canceling the associated effect \
          before child state changes to another case, especially if it is a long-living effect.

          • This action was sent to the store while state was another case. Make sure that actions \
          for this reducer can only be sent from a view store when state is set to the appropriate \
          case. In SwiftUI applications, use "SwitchStore".
