/// A store represents the runtime that powers the application. It is the object that you will pass
/// around to views that need to interact with the application.
///
/// You will typically construct a single one of these at the root of your application:
///
/// ```swift
/// @main
/// struct MyApp: App {
///   var body: some Scene {
///     WindowGroup {
///       RootView(
///         store: Store(initialState: AppFeature.State()) {
///           AppFeature()
///         }
///       )
///     }
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// â€¦and then use the ``scope(state:action:)-90255`` method to derive more focused stores that can be
/// passed to subviews.
///
/// ### Scoping
///
/// The most important operation defined on ``Store`` is the ``scope(state:action:)-90255`` method,
/// which allows you to transform a store into one that deals with child state and actions. This is
/// necessary for passing stores to subviews that only care about a small portion of the entire
/// application's domain.
///
/// For example, if an application has a tab view at its root with tabs for activity, search, and
/// profile, then we can model the domain like this:
///
/// ```swift
/// @Reducer
/// struct AppFeature {
///   struct State {
///     var activity: Activity.State
///     var profile: Profile.State
///     var search: Search.State
///   }
///
///   enum Action {
///     case activity(Activity.Action)
///     case profile(Profile.Action)
///     case search(Search.Action)
///   }
///
///   // ...
/// }
/// ```
///
/// We can construct a view for each of these domains by applying ``scope(state:action:)-90255`` to
/// a store that holds onto the full app domain in order to transform it into a store for each
/// subdomain:
///
/// ```swift
/// struct AppView: View {
///   let store: StoreOf<AppFeature>
///
///   var body: some View {
///     TabView {
///       ActivityView(
///         store: store.scope(state: \.activity, action: \.activity)
///       )
///       .tabItem { Text("Activity") }
///
///       SearchView(
///         store: store.scope(state: \.search, action: \.search)
///       )
///       .tabItem { Text("Search") }
///
///       ProfileView(
///         store: store.scope(state: \.profile, action: \.profile)
///       )
///       .tabItem { Text("Profile") }
///     }
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ### Thread safety
///
/// The `Store` class is not thread-safe, and so all interactions with an instance of ``Store``
/// (including all of its scopes and derived ``ViewStore``s) must be done on the same thread the
/// store was created on. Further, if the store is powering a SwiftUI or UIKit view, as is
/// customary, then all interactions must be done on the _main_ thread.
///
/// The reason stores are not thread-safe is due to the fact that when an action is sent to a store,
/// a reducer is run on the current state, and this process cannot be done from multiple threads.
/// It is possible to make this process thread-safe by introducing locks or queues, but this
/// introduces new complications:
///
///   * If done simply with `DispatchQueue.main.async` you will incur a thread hop even when you are
///     already on the main thread. This can lead to unexpected behavior in UIKit and SwiftUI, where
///     sometimes you are required to do work synchronously, such as in animation blocks.
///
///   * It is possible to create a scheduler that performs its work immediately when on the main
///     thread and otherwise uses `DispatchQueue.main.async` (_e.g._, see Combine Schedulers'
///     [UIScheduler][uischeduler]).
///
/// This introduces a lot more complexity, and should probably not be adopted without having a very
/// good reason.
///
/// This is why we require all actions be sent from the same thread. This requirement is in the same
/// spirit of how `URLSession` and other Apple APIs are designed. Those APIs tend to deliver their
/// outputs on whatever thread is most convenient for them, and then it is your responsibility to
/// dispatch back to the main queue if that's what you need. The Composable Architecture makes you
/// responsible for making sure to send actions on the main thread. If you are using an effect that
/// may deliver its output on a non-main thread, you must explicitly perform `.receive(on:)` in
/// order to force it back on the main thread.
///
/// This approach makes the fewest number of assumptions about how effects are created and
/// transformed, and prevents unnecessary thread hops and re-dispatching. It also provides some
/// testing benefits. If your effects are not responsible for their own scheduling, then in tests
/// all of the effects would run synchronously and immediately. You would not be able to test how
/// multiple in-flight effects interleave with each other and affect the state of your application.
/// However, by leaving scheduling out of the ``Store`` we get to test these aspects of our effects
/// if we so desire, or we can ignore if we prefer. We have that flexibility.
///
/// [uischeduler]: https://github.com/pointfreeco/combine-schedulers/blob/main/Sources/CombineSchedulers/UIScheduler.swift
///
/// #### Thread safety checks
///
/// The store performs some basic thread safety checks in order to help catch mistakes. Stores
/// constructed via the initializer ``init(initialState:reducer:withDependencies:)`` are assumed
/// to run only on the main thread, and so a check is executed immediately to make sure that is the
/// case. Further, all actions sent to the store and all scopes (see ``scope(state:action:)-90255``)
/// of the store are also checked to make sure that work is performed on the main thread.
