  This screen demonstrates how one can create reusable components in the Composable Architecture.

  The "download component" is a component that can be added to any view to enhance it with the \
  concept of downloading offline content. It facilitates downloading the data, displaying a \
  progress view while downloading, canceling an active download, and deleting previously \
  downloaded data.

  Tap the download icon to start a download, and tap again to cancel an in-flight download or to \
  remove a finished download. While a file is downloading you can tap a row to go to another \
  screen to see that the state is carried over.
