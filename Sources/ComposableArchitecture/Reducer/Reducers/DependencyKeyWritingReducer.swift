extension ReducerProtocol {
  /// Sets the dependency value of the specified key path to the given value.
  ///
  /// This overrides the dependency specified by `keyPath` for the execution of the receiving
  /// reducer _and_ all of its effects. It can be useful for altering the dependencies for just
  /// one portion of your application, while letting the rest of the application continue using the
  /// default live dependencies.
  ///
  /// For example, suppose you are creating an onboarding experience to teach people how to use one
  /// of your features. This can be done by constructing a new reducer that embeds the core
  /// feature's domain and layers on additional logic:
  ///
  /// ```swift
  /// struct Onboarding: ReducerProtocol {
  ///   struct State {
  ///     var feature: Feature.State
  ///     // Additional onboarding state
  ///   }
  ///   enum Action {
  ///     case feature(Feature.Action)
  ///     // Additional onboarding actions
  ///   }
  ///
  ///   var body: some ReducerProtocol<State, Action> {
  ///     Scope(state: \.feature, action: /Action.feature) {
  ///       Feature()
  ///     }
  ///
  ///     Reduce { state, action in
  ///       // Additional onboarding logic
  ///     }
  ///   }
  /// }
  /// ```
  ///
  /// This can work just fine, but the `Feature` reducer will have access to all of the live
  /// dependencies by default, and that might not be ideal. For example, the `Feature` reducer
  /// may need to make API requests and read/write from user defaults. It may be preferable
  /// to run the `Feature` reducer in an alternative environment for onboarding purposes, such
  /// as an API client that returns some mock data or an in-memory user defaults so that the
  /// onboarding experience doesn't accidentally trample on shared data.
  ///
  /// This can be by using the ``dependency(_:_:)`` method to override those dependencies
  /// just for the `Feature` reducer and its effects:
  ///
  /// ```swift
  /// var body: some ReducerProtocol<State, Action> {
  ///   Scope(state: \.feature, action: /Action.feature) {
  ///     Feature()
  ///       .dependency(\.apiClient, .mock)
  ///       .dependency(\.userDefaults, .mock)
  ///   }
  ///
  ///   Reduce { state, action in
  ///     // Additional onboarding logic
  ///   }
  /// }
  /// ```
  ///
  /// See ``transformDependency(_:transform:)`` for a similar method that can inspect and modify the
  /// current dependency when overriding.
  ///
  /// - Parameters:
  ///   - keyPath: A key path that indicates the property of the `DependencyValues` structure to
  ///     update.
  ///   - value: The new value to set for the item specified by `keyPath`.
  /// - Returns: A reducer that has the given value set in its dependencies.

  ///
  /// This is similar to ``dependency(_:_:)``, except it allows you to mutate a dependency value
  /// directly. This can be handy when you want to alter a dependency but still use its current
  /// value.
  ///
  /// For example, suppose you want to see when a particular endpoint of a dependency gets called
  /// in your application. You can override that endpoint to insert a breakpoint or print state,
  /// but still call out to the original endpoint:
  ///
  /// ```swift
  ///   Feature()
  ///     .transformDependency(\.speechClient) { speechClient in
  ///       speechClient.requestAuthorization = {
  ///         print("requestAuthorization")

  ///
  /// - Parameters:
  ///   - keyPath: A key path that indicates the property of the `DependencyValues` structure to

  ///     path.
