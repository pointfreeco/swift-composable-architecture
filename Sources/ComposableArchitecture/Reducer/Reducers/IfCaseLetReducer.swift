extension Reducer {
  /// Embeds a child reducer in a parent domain that works on a case of parent enum state.
  ///
  /// For example, if a parent feature's state is expressed as an enum of multiple children
  /// states, then `ifCaseLet` can run a child reducer on a particular case of the enum:
  ///
  /// ```swift
  /// @Reducer
  /// struct Parent {
  ///   enum State {
  ///     case loggedIn(Authenticated.State)
  ///     case loggedOut(Unauthenticated.State)
  ///   }
  ///   enum Action {
  ///     case loggedIn(Authenticated.Action)
  ///     case loggedOut(Unauthenticated.Action)
  ///     // ...
  ///   }
  ///
  ///   var body: some Reducer<State, Action> {
  ///     Reduce { state, action in
  ///       // Core logic for parent feature
  ///     }
  ///     .ifCaseLet(\.loggedIn, action: \.loggedIn) {
  ///       Authenticated()
  ///     }
  ///     .ifCaseLet(\.loggedOut, action: \.loggedOut) {
  ///       Unauthenticated()
  ///     }
  ///   }
  /// }
  /// ```
  ///
  /// The `ifCaseLet` operator does a number of things to try to enforce correctness:
  ///
  ///   * It forces a specific order of operations for the child and parent features. It runs the
  ///     child first, and then the parent. If the order was reversed, then it would be possible for
  ///     for the parent feature to change the case of the child enum, in which case the child
  ///     feature would not be able to react to that action. That can cause subtle bugs.
  ///
  ///   * It automatically cancels all child effects when it detects the child enum case changes.
  ///
  /// It is still possible for a parent feature higher up in the application to change the case of
  /// the enum before the child has a chance to react to the action. In such cases a runtime
  /// warning is shown in Xcode to let you know that there's a potential problem.
  ///
  /// - Parameters:
  ///   - toCaseState: A case path from parent state to a case containing child state.
  ///   - toCaseAction: A case path from parent action to a case containing child actions.
  ///   - case: A reducer that will be invoked with child actions against child state when it is
  ///     present
  /// - Returns: A reducer that combines the child reducer with the parent reducer.

        An "ifCaseLet" at "\(self.fileID):\(self.line)" received a child action when child state \

          Action:
        \(actionDump)
          State:
        \(stateDump)

        This is generally considered an application logic error, and can happen for a few reasons:

        • A parent reducer set "\(typeName(Parent.State.self))" to a different case before this \
        reducer ran. This reducer must run before any other reducer sets child state to a \
        different case. This ensures that child reducers can handle their actions while their \
        state is still available.

        • An in-flight effect emitted this action when child state was unavailable. While it may \
        be perfectly reasonable to ignore this action, consider canceling the associated effect \
        before child state changes to another case, especially if it is a long-living effect.

        • This action was sent to the store while state was another case. Make sure that actions \
        for this reducer can only be sent from a view store when state is set to the appropriate \
        case. In SwiftUI applications, use "SwitchStore".
