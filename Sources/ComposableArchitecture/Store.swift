/// A store represents the runtime that powers the application. It is the object that you will pass
/// around to views that need to interact with the application.
///
/// You will typically construct a single one of these at the root of your application:
///
/// ```swift
/// @main
/// struct MyApp: App {
///   var body: some Scene {
///     WindowGroup {
///       RootView(
///         store: Store(initialState: AppFeature.State()) {
///           AppFeature()
///         }
///       )
///     }
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// â€¦and then use the ``scope(state:action:)-90255`` method to derive more focused stores that can be
/// passed to subviews.
///
/// ### Scoping
///
/// The most important operation defined on ``Store`` is the ``scope(state:action:)-90255`` method,
/// which allows you to transform a store into one that deals with child state and actions. This is
/// necessary for passing stores to subviews that only care about a small portion of the entire
/// application's domain.
///
/// For example, if an application has a tab view at its root with tabs for activity, search, and
/// profile, then we can model the domain like this:
///
/// ```swift
/// @Reducer
/// struct AppFeature {
///   struct State {
///     var activity: Activity.State
///     var profile: Profile.State
///     var search: Search.State
///   }
///
///   enum Action {
///     case activity(Activity.Action)
///     case profile(Profile.Action)
///     case search(Search.Action)
///   }
///
///   // ...
/// }
/// ```
///
/// We can construct a view for each of these domains by applying ``scope(state:action:)-90255`` to
/// a store that holds onto the full app domain in order to transform it into a store for each
/// subdomain:
///
/// ```swift
/// struct AppView: View {
///   let store: StoreOf<AppFeature>
///
///   var body: some View {
///     TabView {
///       ActivityView(
///         store: self.store.scope(state: \.activity, action: \.activity)
///       )
///       .tabItem { Text("Activity") }
///
///       SearchView(
///         store: self.store.scope(state: \.search, action: \.search)
///       )
///       .tabItem { Text("Search") }
///
///       ProfileView(
///         store: self.store.scope(state: \.profile, action: \.profile)
///       )
///       .tabItem { Text("Profile") }
///     }
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ### Thread safety
///
/// The `Store` class is not thread-safe, and so all interactions with an instance of ``Store``
/// (including all of its scopes and derived ``ViewStore``s) must be done on the same thread the
/// store was created on. Further, if the store is powering a SwiftUI or UIKit view, as is
/// customary, then all interactions must be done on the _main_ thread.
///
/// The reason stores are not thread-safe is due to the fact that when an action is sent to a store,
/// a reducer is run on the current state, and this process cannot be done from multiple threads.
/// It is possible to make this process thread-safe by introducing locks or queues, but this
/// introduces new complications:
///
///   * If done simply with `DispatchQueue.main.async` you will incur a thread hop even when you are
///     already on the main thread. This can lead to unexpected behavior in UIKit and SwiftUI, where
///     sometimes you are required to do work synchronously, such as in animation blocks.
///
///   * It is possible to create a scheduler that performs its work immediately when on the main
///     thread and otherwise uses `DispatchQueue.main.async` (_e.g._, see Combine Schedulers'
///     [UIScheduler][uischeduler]).
///
/// This introduces a lot more complexity, and should probably not be adopted without having a very
/// good reason.
///
/// This is why we require all actions be sent from the same thread. This requirement is in the same
/// spirit of how `URLSession` and other Apple APIs are designed. Those APIs tend to deliver their
/// outputs on whatever thread is most convenient for them, and then it is your responsibility to
/// dispatch back to the main queue if that's what you need. The Composable Architecture makes you
/// responsible for making sure to send actions on the main thread. If you are using an effect that
/// may deliver its output on a non-main thread, you must explicitly perform `.receive(on:)` in
/// order to force it back on the main thread.
///
/// This approach makes the fewest number of assumptions about how effects are created and
/// transformed, and prevents unnecessary thread hops and re-dispatching. It also provides some
/// testing benefits. If your effects are not responsible for their own scheduling, then in tests
/// all of the effects would run synchronously and immediately. You would not be able to test how
/// multiple in-flight effects interleave with each other and affect the state of your application.
/// However, by leaving scheduling out of the ``Store`` we get to test these aspects of our effects
/// if we so desire, or we can ignore if we prefer. We have that flexibility.
///
/// [uischeduler]: https://github.com/pointfreeco/combine-schedulers/blob/main/Sources/CombineSchedulers/UIScheduler.swift
///
/// #### Thread safety checks
///
/// The store performs some basic thread safety checks in order to help catch mistakes. Stores
/// constructed via the initializer ``init(initialState:reducer:withDependencies:)`` are assumed
/// to run only on the main thread, and so a check is executed immediately to make sure that is the
/// case. Further, all actions sent to the store and all scopes (see ``scope(state:action:)-90255``)
/// of the store are also checked to make sure that work is performed on the main thread.

  ///     // ...
  ///   }
  ///   enum Action {
  ///     case login(Login.Action)
  ///     // ...
  ///   }
  ///   // ...
  /// }
  ///
  /// // A store that runs the entire application.
  /// let store = Store(initialState: AppFeature.State()) {
  ///   AppFeature()
  /// }
  ///
  /// // Construct a login view by scoping the store
  /// // to one that works with only login domain.
  /// LoginView(
  ///   store: store.scope(state: \.login, action: \.login)
  /// )
  /// ```
  ///
  /// Scoping in this fashion allows you to better modularize your application. In this case,
  /// `LoginView` could be extracted to a module that has no access to `AppFeature.State` or
  /// `AppFeature.Action`.
  ///
  /// Scoping also gives a view the opportunity to focus on just the state and actions it cares
  /// about, even if its feature domain is larger.
  ///
  /// For example, the above login domain could model a two screen login flow: a login form followed
  /// by a two-factor authentication screen. The second screen's domain might be nested in the
  /// first:
  ///
  /// ```swift
  /// @Reducer
  /// struct Login {
  ///   struct State: Equatable {
  ///     var email = ""
  ///     var password = ""
  ///     var twoFactorAuth: TwoFactorAuthState?
  ///   }
  ///   enum Action {
  ///     case emailChanged(String)
  ///     case loginButtonTapped
  ///     case loginResponse(Result<TwoFactorAuthState, LoginError>)
  ///     case passwordChanged(String)
  ///     case twoFactorAuth(TwoFactorAuthAction)
  ///   }
  ///   // ...
  /// }
  /// ```
  ///
  /// The login view holds onto a store of this domain:
  ///
  /// ```swift
  /// struct LoginView: View {
  ///   let store: StoreOf<Login>
  ///
  ///   var body: some View { /* ... */ }
  /// }
  /// ```
  ///
  /// If its body were to use a view store of the same domain, this would introduce a number of
  /// problems:
  ///
  /// * The login view would be able to read from `twoFactorAuth` state. This state is only intended
  ///   to be read from the two-factor auth screen.
  ///
  /// * Even worse, changes to `twoFactorAuth` state would now cause SwiftUI to recompute
  ///   `LoginView`'s body unnecessarily.
  ///
  /// * The login view would be able to send `twoFactorAuth` actions. These actions are only
  ///   intended to be sent from the two-factor auth screen (and reducer).
  ///
  /// * The login view would be able to send non user-facing login actions, like `loginResponse`.
  ///   These actions are only intended to be used in the login reducer to feed the results of
  ///   effects back into the store.
  ///
  /// To avoid these issues, one can introduce a view-specific domain that slices off the subset of
  /// state and actions that a view cares about:
  ///
  /// ```swift
  /// extension LoginView {
  ///   struct ViewState: Equatable {
  ///     var email: String
  ///     var password: String
  ///   }
  ///
  ///   enum ViewAction {
  ///     case emailChanged(String)
  ///     case loginButtonTapped
  ///     case passwordChanged(String)
  ///   }
  /// }
  /// ```
  ///
  /// One can also introduce a couple helpers that transform feature state into view state and
  /// transform view actions into feature actions.
  ///
  /// ```swift
  /// extension Login.State {
  ///   var view: LoginView.ViewState {
  ///     .init(email: self.email, password: self.password)
  ///   }
  /// }
  ///
  /// extension LoginView.ViewAction {
  ///   var feature: Login.Action {
  ///     switch self {
  ///     case let .emailChanged(email)
  ///       return .emailChanged(email)
  ///     case .loginButtonTapped:
  ///       return .loginButtonTapped
  ///     case let .passwordChanged(password)
  ///       return .passwordChanged(password)
  ///     }
  ///   }
  /// }
  /// ```
  ///
  /// With these helpers defined, `LoginView` can now scope its store's feature domain into its view
  /// domain:
  ///
  /// ```swift
  ///  var body: some View {
  ///    WithViewStore(
  ///      self.store, observe: \.view, send: \.feature
  ///    ) { viewStore in
  ///      // ...

  ///  }
  /// ```
