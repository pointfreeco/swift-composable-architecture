/// Execute this in the effect returned from a reducer in order to dismiss the feature:
///
/// ```swift
/// struct ChildFeature: Reducer {
///   struct State { /* ... */ }
///   enum Action {
///     case exitButtonTapped
///     // ...
///   }
///   @Dependency(\.dismiss) var dismiss
///   func reduce(into state: inout State, action: Action) -> Effect<Action> {
///     switch action {
///     case .exitButtonTapped:
///       return .run { _ in await self.dismiss() }
///     // ...
///     }
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// This operation works by finding the nearest parent feature that was presented using either the
/// ``Reducer/ifLet(_:action:destination:fileID:line:)`` or the
/// ``Reducer/forEach(_:action:destination:fileID:line:)`` operator, and then dismisses _that_
/// feature. It performs the dismissal by either sending the ``PresentationAction/dismiss`` in the
/// case of `ifLet` or sending ``StackAction/popFrom(id:)`` in the case of `forEach`.
///
/// It is also possible to dismiss the feature using an animation by providing an argument to the
/// `dismiss` function:
///
/// ```swift
/// case .exitButtonTapped:
///   return .run { _ in await self.dismiss(animation: .default) }
/// ```
///
/// This will cause the `dismiss` or `popFrom(id:)` action to be sent with the particular animation.
///
/// > Warning: The `@Dependency(\.dismiss)` tool only works for features that are presented using
/// > the `ifLet` operator for tree-based navigation (see <doc:TreeBasedNavigation> for more info)
/// > or `forEach` operator for stack-based navigation (see <doc:StackBasedNavigation>). If no
/// > parent feature is found that was presented with `ifLet` or `forEach`, then a runtime warning
/// > is emitted in Xcode letting you know that it is not possible to dismiss. Further, the runtime
/// > warning becomes a test failure when run in tests.
/// >
/// > If you are testing a child feature in isolation that makes use of `@Dependency(\.dismiss)`
/// > then you will need to override the dependency to get a passing test. You can even mutate
/// > some shared mutable state inside the `dismiss` closure to confirm that it is indeed invoked:
/// >
/// > ```swift
/// > let isDismissInvoked: LockIsolated<[Bool]> = .init([])
/// > let store = TestStore(initialState: Child.State()) {
/// >   Child()
/// > } withDependencies: {
/// >   $0.dismiss = DismissEffect { isDismissInvoked.withValue { $0.append(true) } }
/// > }
/// >
/// > await store.send(.exitButtonTapped) {
/// >   // ...
/// > }
/// > XCTAssertEqual(isDismissInvoked.value, [true])
/// > ```
