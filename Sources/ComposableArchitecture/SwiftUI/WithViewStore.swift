/// A view helper that transforms a ``Store`` into a ``ViewStore`` so that its state can be observed
/// by a view builder.
///
/// This helper is an alternative to observing the view store manually on your view, which requires
/// the boilerplate of a custom initializer.
///
/// For example, the following view, which manually observes the store it is handed by constructing
/// a view store in its initializer:
///
/// ```swift
/// struct ProfileView: View {
///   let store: Store<ProfileState, ProfileAction>
///   @ObservedObject var viewStore: ViewStore<ProfileState, ProfileAction>
///
///   init(store: Store<ProfileState, ProfileAction>) {
///     self.store = store
///     self.viewStore = ViewStore(store)
///   }
///
///   var body: some View {
///     Text("\(self.viewStore.username)")
///     // ...
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// â€¦can be written more simply using `WithViewStore`:
///
/// ```swift
/// struct ProfileView: View {
///   let store: Store<ProfileState, ProfileAction>
///
///   var body: some View {
///     WithViewStore(self.store, observe: { $0 }) { viewStore in
///       Text("\(viewStore.username)")
///       // ...
///     }
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// There may be times where the slightly more verbose style of observing a store is preferred
/// instead of using ``WithViewStore``:
///
/// 1. When ``WithViewStore`` wraps complex views the Swift compiler can quickly become bogged down,
/// leading to degraded compiler performance and diagnostics. If you are experience such instability
/// you should consider manually setting up observation with an `@ObservedObject` property as
/// described above.
///
/// 2. Sometimes you may want to observe the state in a store in a context that is not a view
/// builder. In such cases ``WithViewStore`` will not work since it is intended only for SwiftUI
/// views.
///
///    An example of this is interfacing with SwiftUI's `App` protocol, which uses a separate
///    `@SceneBuilder` instead of `@ViewBuilder`. In this case you must use an `@ObservedObject`:
///
///    ```swift
///    @main
///    struct MyApp: App {
///      let store = Store<AppState, AppAction>(/* ... */)
///      @ObservedObject var viewStore: ViewStore<SceneState, CommandAction>
///
///      struct SceneState: Equatable {
///        // ...
///        init(state: AppState) {
///          // ...
///        }
///      }
///
///      init() {
///        self.viewStore = ViewStore(
///          self.store.scope(
///            state: SceneState.init(state:)
///            action: AppAction.scene
///          )
///        )
///      }
///
///      var body: some Scene {
///        WindowGroup {
///          MyRootView()
///        }
///        .commands {
///          CommandMenu("Help") {
///            Button("About \(self.viewStore.appName)") {
///              self.viewStore.send(.aboutButtonTapped)
///            }
///          }
///        }
///      }
///    }
///    ```
///
///    Note that it is highly discouraged for you to observe _all_ of your root store's state.
///    It is almost never needed and will cause many view recomputations leading to poor
///    performance. This is why we construct a separate `SceneState` type that holds onto only the
///    state that the view needs for rendering. See <doc:Performance> for more information on this
///    topic.
///
/// If your view does not need access to any state in the store and only needs to be able to send
/// actions, then you should consider not using ``WithViewStore`` at all. Instead, you can send
/// actions to a ``Store`` in a lightweight way like so:
///
/// ```swift
/// Button("Tap me") {
///   ViewStore(self.store).send(.buttonTapped)
/// }
/// ```
