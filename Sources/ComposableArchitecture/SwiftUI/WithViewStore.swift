/// A structure that transforms a store into an observable view store in order to compute views from
/// store state.
///
/// Due to a bug in SwiftUI, there are times that use of this view can interfere with some core
/// views provided by SwiftUI. The known problematic views are:
///
/// * If a `GeometryReader` is used inside a `WithViewStore` it will not receive state updates
///   correctly. To work around you either need to reorder the views so that `GeometryReader`
///   wraps the `WithViewStore`, or, if that is not possible, then you must hold onto an explicit
///   `@ObservedObject var viewStore: ViewStore<State, Action>` in your view in lieu of using
///   this helper (see [here](https://gist.github.com/mbrandonw/cc5da3d487bcf7c4f21c27019a440d18)).
/// * If you create a `Stepper` via the `Stepper.init(onIncrement:onDecrement:label:)` initializer
///   inside a `WithViewStore` it will behave erratically. To work around you should use the
///   initializer that takes a binding (see
///   [here](https://gist.github.com/mbrandonw/dee2ceac2c316a1619cfdf1dc7945f66)).
