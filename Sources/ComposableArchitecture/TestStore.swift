  /// A testable runtime for a reducer.
  ///
  /// This object aids in writing expressive and exhaustive tests for features built in the
  /// Composable Architecture. It allows you to send a sequence of actions to the store, and each
  /// step of the way you must assert exactly how state changed, and how effect emissions were fed
  /// back into the system.
  ///
  /// There are multiple ways the test store forces you to exhaustively assert on how your feature
  /// behaves:
  ///
  ///   * After each action is sent you must describe precisely how the state changed from before
  ///     the action was sent to after it was sent.
  ///
  ///     If even the smallest piece of data differs the test will fail. This guarantees that you
  ///     are proving you know precisely how the state of the system changes.
  ///
  ///   * Sending an action can sometimes cause an effect to be executed, and if that effect emits
  ///     an action that is fed back into the system, you **must** explicitly assert that you expect
  ///     to receive that action from the effect, _and_ you must assert how state changed as a
  ///     result.
  ///
  ///     If you try to send another action before you have handled all effect emissions the
  ///     assertion will fail. This guarantees that you do not accidentally forget about an effect
  ///     emission, and that the sequence of steps you are describing will mimic how the application
  ///     behaves in reality.
  ///
  ///   * All effects must complete by the time the assertion has finished running the steps you
  ///     specify.
  ///
  ///     If at the end of the assertion there is still an in-flight effect running, the assertion
  ///     will fail. This helps exhaustively prove that you know what effects are in flight and
  ///     forces you to prove that effects will not cause any future changes to your state.
  ///
  /// For example, given a simple counter reducer:
  ///
  /// ```swift
  /// struct CounterState {
  ///   var count = 0
  /// }
  /// enum CounterAction: Equatable {
  ///   case decrementButtonTapped
  ///   case incrementButtonTapped
  /// }
  ///
  /// let counterReducer = Reducer<CounterState, CounterAction, Void> { state, action, _ in
  ///   switch action {
  ///   case .decrementButtonTapped:
  ///     state.count -= 1
  ///     return .none
  ///
  ///   case .incrementButtonTapped:
  ///     state.count += 1
  ///     return .none
  ///   }
  /// }
  /// ```
  ///
  /// One can assert against its behavior over time:
  ///
  /// ```swift
  /// @MainActor
  /// class CounterTests: XCTestCase {
  ///   func testCounter() async {
  ///     let store = TestStore(
  ///       initialState: CounterState(count: 0),     // Given a counter state of 0
  ///       reducer: counterReducer,
  ///       environment: ()
  ///     )
  ///     await store.send(.incrementButtonTapped) {  // When the increment button is tapped
  ///       $0.count = 1                              // Then the count should be 1
  ///     }
  ///   }
  /// }
  /// ```
  ///
  /// Note that in the trailing closure of `.send(.incrementButtonTapped)` we are given a single
  /// mutable value of the state before the action was sent, and it is our job to mutate the value
  /// to match the state after the action was sent. In this case the `count` field changes to `1`.
  ///
  /// For a more complex example, consider the following bare-bones search feature that uses the
  /// ``Effect/debounce(id:for:scheduler:options:)-76yye`` operator to wait for the user to stop
  /// typing before making a network request:
  ///
  /// ```swift
  /// struct SearchState: Equatable {
  ///   var query = ""
  ///   var results: [String] = []
  /// }
  ///
  /// enum SearchAction: Equatable {
  ///   case queryChanged(String)
  ///   case response([String])
  /// }
  ///
  /// struct SearchEnvironment {
  ///   var mainQueue: AnySchedulerOf<DispatchQueue>
  ///   var request: (String) async throws -> [String]
  /// }
  ///
  /// let searchReducer = Reducer<SearchState, SearchAction, SearchEnvironment> {
  ///   state, action, environment in
  ///     switch action {
  ///     case let .queryChanged(query):
  ///       enum SearchID {}
  ///
  ///       state.query = query
  ///       return .run { send in
  ///         guard let results = try? await environment.request(query) else { return }
  ///         send(.response(results))
  ///       }
  ///       .debounce(id: SearchID.self, for: 0.5, scheduler: environment.mainQueue)
  ///
  ///     case let .response(results):
  ///       state.results = results
  ///       return .none
  ///     }
  /// }
  /// ```
  ///
  /// It can be fully tested by controlling the environment's scheduler and effect:
  ///
  /// ```swift
  /// // Create a test dispatch scheduler to control the timing of effects
  /// let mainQueue = DispatchQueue.test
  ///
  /// let store = TestStore(

  ///     // Wrap the test scheduler in a type-erased scheduler
  ///     mainQueue: mainQueue.eraseToAnyScheduler(),
  ///     // Simulate a search response with one item
  ///     request: { ["Composable Architecture"] }
  ///   )
  /// )
  ///
  /// // Change the query
  /// await store.send(.searchFieldChanged("c") {
  ///   // Assert that state updates accordingly
  ///   $0.query = "c"
  /// }
  ///
  /// // Advance the queue by a period shorter than the debounce

          • If using async/await in your effect, it may need a little bit of time to properly \

          sure that you wait enough time for the scheduler to perform the effect. If you are using \
          a test scheduler, advance the scheduler so that the effects may complete, or consider \
          using an immediate scheduler to immediately perform the effect instead.

          • If you are returning a long-living effect (timers, notifications, subjects, etc.), \
          then make sure those effects are torn down by marking the effect ".cancellable" and \
          returning a corresponding cancellation effect ("Effect.cancel") from another action, or, \
          if your effect is driven by a Combine subject, send it a completion.
