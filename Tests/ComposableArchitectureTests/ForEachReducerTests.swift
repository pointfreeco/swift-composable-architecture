          This is generally considered an application logic error, and can happen for a few reasons:

          • A parent reducer removed an element with this ID before this reducer ran. This reducer \
          must run before any other reducer removes an element, which ensures that element reducers \
          can handle their actions while their state is still available.

          • An in-flight effect emitted this action when state contained no element at this ID. \
          While it may be perfectly reasonable to ignore this action, consider canceling the \
          associated effect before an element is removed, especially if it is a long-living effect.

          • This action was sent to the store while its state contained no element at this ID. To \
          fix this make sure that actions for this reducer can only be sent from a view store when \
          its state contains an element at this id. In SwiftUI applications, use "ForEachStore".
