/// A testable runtime for a reducer.
///
/// This object aids in writing expressive and exhaustive tests for features built in the
/// Composable Architecture. It allows you to send a sequence of actions to the store, and each
/// step of the way you must assert exactly how state changed, and how effect emissions were fed
/// back into the system.
///
/// There are multiple ways the test store forces you to exhaustively assert on how your feature
/// behaves:
///
///   * After each action is sent you must describe precisely how the state changed from before
///     the action was sent to after it was sent.
///
///     If even the smallest piece of data differs the test will fail. This guarantees that you
///     are proving you know precisely how the state of the system changes.
///
///   * Sending an action can sometimes cause an effect to be executed, and if that effect emits
///     an action that is fed back into the system, you **must** explicitly assert that you expect
///     to receive that action from the effect, _and_ you must assert how state changed as a
///     result.
///
///     If you try to send another action before you have handled all effect emissions the
///     assertion will fail. This guarantees that you do not accidentally forget about an effect
///     emission, and that the sequence of steps you are describing will mimic how the application
///     behaves in reality.
///
///   * All effects must complete by the time the assertion has finished running the steps you
///     specify.
///
///     If at the end of the assertion there is still an in-flight effect running, the assertion
///     will fail. This helps exhaustively prove that you know what effects are in flight and
///     forces you to prove that effects will not cause any future changes to your state.
///
/// For example, given a simple counter reducer:
///
/// ```swift
/// struct Counter: ReducerProtocol {
///   struct State: Equatable {
///     var count = 0
///   }
///
///   enum Action {
///     case decrementButtonTapped
///     case incrementButtonTapped
///   }
///
///   func reduce(
///     into state: inout State, action: Action
///   ) -> Effect<Action, Never> {
///     switch action {
///     case .decrementButtonTapped:
///       state.count -= 1
///       return .none
///
///     case .incrementButtonTapped:
///       state.count += 1
///       return .none
///     }
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// One can assert against its behavior over time:
///
/// ```swift
/// @MainActor
/// class CounterTests: XCTestCase {
///   func testCounter() async {
///     let store = TestStore(
///       // Given a counter state of 0
///       initialState: Counter.State(count: 0),
///       reducer: Counter()
///     )
///
///     // When the increment button is tapped
///     await store.send(.incrementButtonTapped) {
///       // Then the count should be 1
///       $0.count = 1
///     }
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Note that in the trailing closure of `.send(.incrementButtonTapped)` we are given a single
/// mutable value of the state before the action was sent, and it is our job to mutate the value
/// to match the state after the action was sent. In this case the `count` field changes to `1`.
///
/// For a more complex example, consider the following bare-bones search feature that uses a
/// scheduler and cancel token to debounce requests:
///
/// ```swift
/// struct Search: ReducerProtocol {
///   struct State: Equatable {
///     var query = ""
///     var results: [String] = []
///   }
///
///   enum Action: Equatable {
///     case queryChanged(String)
///     case response([String])
///   }
///
///   @Dependency(\.apiClient) var apiClient
///   @Dependency(\.mainQueue) var mainQueue
///
///   func reduce(
///     into state: inout State, action: Action
///   ) -> Effect<Action, Never> {
///     switch action {
///     case let .queryChanged(query):
///       enum SearchID {}
///
///       state.query = query
///       return .run { send in
///         try await self.mainQueue.sleep(for: 0.5)
///
///         guard let results = try? await self.apiClient.search(query)
///         else { return }
///
///         await send(.response(results))
///       }
///       .cancellable(id: SearchID.self, cancelInFlight: true)
///
///     case let .response(results):
///       state.results = results
///       return .none
///     }
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// It can be fully tested by overriding the `mainQueue` and `apiClient` dependencies with values
/// that are fully controlled and deterministic:
///
/// ```swift
/// let store = TestStore(
///   initialState: Search.State(),
///   reducer: Search
/// )
///
/// // Create a test dispatch scheduler to control the timing of effects
/// let mainQueue = DispatchQueue.test
/// store.dependencies.mainQueue = mainQueue.eraseToAnyScheduler()
///
/// // Simulate a search response with one item
/// store.dependencies.mainQueue.apiClient.search = { _ in
///   ["Composable Architecture"]
/// }
///
/// // Change the query
/// await store.send(.searchFieldChanged("c") {
///   // Assert that state updates accordingly
///   $0.query = "c"
/// }
///
/// // Advance the queue by a period shorter than the debounce
/// await mainQueue.advance(by: 0.25)
///
/// // Change the query again
/// await store.send(.searchFieldChanged("co") {
///   $0.query = "co"
/// }
///
/// // Advance the queue by a period shorter than the debounce
/// await mainQueue.advance(by: 0.25)
/// // Advance the scheduler to the debounce
/// await scheduler.advance(by: 0.25)
///
/// // Assert that the expected response is received
/// await store.receive(.response(["Composable Architecture"])) {
///   // Assert that state updates accordingly
///   $0.results = ["Composable Architecture"]
/// }
/// ```
///
/// This test is proving that the debounced network requests are correctly canceled when we do not
/// wait longer than the 0.5 seconds, because if it wasn't and it delivered an action when we did
/// not expect it would cause a test failure.

        a test scheduler, advance the scheduler so that the effects may complete, or consider \
        using an immediate scheduler to immediately perform the effect instead.

        • If you are returning a long-living effect (timers, notifications, subjects, etc.), \
        then make sure those effects are torn down by marking the effect ".cancellable" and \
        returning a corresponding cancellation effect ("Effect.cancel") from another action, or, \
        if your effect is driven by a Combine subject, send it a completion.
