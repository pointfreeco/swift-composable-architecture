# Migration guides

Learn how to upgrade your application to the newest version of the Composable Architecture.

## Overview

The Composable Architecture is under constant development, and we are always looking for ways to
simplify the library, and make it more powerful. As such, we often need to deprecate certain APIs
in favor of newer ones. We recommend people update their code as quickly as possible to the newest
APIs, and these guides contain tips to do so.

> Important: Before following any particular migration guide be sure you have followed all the
