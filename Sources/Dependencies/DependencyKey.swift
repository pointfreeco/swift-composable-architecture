/// Types conform to this protocol to extend ``DependencyValues`` with custom dependencies. It is
/// similar to SwiftUI's `EnvironmentKey` protocol, which is used to add values to
/// `EnvironmentValues`.
///
/// `DependencyKey` has one main requirement, ``liveValue``, which must return a default value for
/// your dependency that is used when the application is run in a simulator or device. If the
/// ``liveValue`` is accessed while your feature runs in a `TestStore` a test failure will be
/// triggered.
///
/// To add a `UserClient` dependency that can fetch and save user values can be done like so:
///
/// ```swift
/// // The user client dependency.
/// struct UserClient {
///   var fetchUser: (User.ID) async throws -> User
///   var saveUser: (User) async throws -> Void
/// }
/// // Conform to DependencyKey to provide a live implementation of
/// // the interface.
/// extension UserClient: DependencyKey {
///   static let liveValue = Self(
///     fetchUser: { /* Make request to fetch user */ },
///     saveUser: { /* Make request to save user */ }
///   )
/// }
/// // Register the dependency within DependencyValues.
/// extension DependencyValues {
///   var userClient: UserClient {
///     get { self[UserClient.self] }
///     set { self[UserClient.self] = newValue }
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// When a dependency is first accessed its value is cached so that it will not be requested again.
/// This means if your `liveValue` is implemented as a computed property instead of a `static let`,
/// then it will only be called a single time:
///
/// ```swift
/// extension UserClient: DependencyKey {
///   static var liveValue: Self {
///     // Only called once when dependency is first accessed.
///     return Self(â€¦)
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// `DependencyKey` inherits from ``TestDependencyKey``, which has two other overridable
/// requirements: ``TestDependencyKey/testValue``, which should return a default value for the
/// purpose of testing, and ``TestDependencyKey/previewValue-8u2sy``, which can return a default
/// value suitable for Xcode previews. When left unimplemented, these endpoints will return the
/// ``liveValue``, instead.
///

/// ``TestDependencyKey`` in your interface module, and conform to `DependencyKey` in your
/// implementation module.
