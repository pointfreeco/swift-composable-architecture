  @Intro(title: "Meet the Composable Architecture") {
    The Composable Architecture (TCA, for short) is a library for building applications in a 
    consistent and understandable way, with composition, testing, and ergonomics in mind. It can be 
    used in SwiftUI, UIKit, and more, and on any Apple platform (iOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS).  
  }
  
  @Chapter(name: "Essentials") {
    Explore the basics of creating a new feature in the Composable Architecture, layering on
    side effects, and writing a complete test suite for the feature.

  @Chapter(name: "Navigation") {
    Learn how to model your domains for navigation from parent feature to child feature, and how to
    do so in a concise manner using optionals, enums and collections.

      Point-Free is a video series that explores advanced topics in the Swift programming language.
      We built nearly every part of the Composable Architecture from first principles in a [long
      series of episodes](https://www.pointfree.co/collections/composable-architecture).
