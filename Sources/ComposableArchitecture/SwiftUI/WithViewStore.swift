/// A view helper that transforms a ``Store`` into a ``ViewStore`` so that its state can be observed
/// by a view builder.
///
/// This helper is an alternative to observing the view store manually on your view, which requires
/// the boilerplate of a custom initializer.
///
/// For example, the following view, which manually observes the store it is handed by constructing
/// a view store in its initializer:
///
/// ```swift
/// struct ProfileView: View {
///   let store: StoreOf<Profile>
///   @ObservedObject var viewStore: ViewStoreOf<Profile>
///
///   init(store: StoreOf<Profile>) {
///     self.store = store
///     self.viewStore = ViewStore(store, observe: { $0 })
///   }
///
///   var body: some View {
///     Text("\(self.viewStore.username)")
///     // ...
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// â€¦can be written more simply using `WithViewStore`:
///
/// ```swift
/// struct ProfileView: View {
///   let store: StoreOf<Profile>
///
///   var body: some View {
///     WithViewStore(self.store, observe: { $0 }) { viewStore in
///       Text("\(viewStore.username)")
///       // ...
///     }
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// There may be times where the slightly more verbose style of observing a store is preferred
/// instead of using ``WithViewStore``:
///
///   1. When ``WithViewStore`` wraps complex views the Swift compiler can quickly become bogged
///      down, leading to degraded compiler performance and diagnostics. If you are experiencing
///      such instability you should consider manually setting up observation with an
///      `@ObservedObject` property as described above.
///
///   2. Sometimes you may want to observe the state in a store in a context that is not a view
///      builder. In such cases ``WithViewStore`` will not work since it is intended only for
///      SwiftUI views.
///
///      An example of this is interfacing with SwiftUI's `App` protocol, which uses a separate
///      `@SceneBuilder` instead of `@ViewBuilder`. In this case you must use an `@ObservedObject`:
///
///      ```swift
///      @main
///      struct MyApp: App {
///        let store = StoreOf<AppFeature>(/* ... */)
///        @ObservedObject var viewStore: ViewStore<SceneState, CommandAction>
///
///        struct SceneState: Equatable {
///          // ...
///          init(state: AppFeature.State) {
///            // ...
///          }
///        }
///
///        init() {
///          self.viewStore = ViewStore(
///            self.store.scope(
///              state: SceneState.init(state:)
///              action: AppFeature.Action.scene
///            )
///          )
///        }
///
///        var body: some Scene {
///          WindowGroup {
///            MyRootView()
///          }
///          .commands {
///            CommandMenu("Help") {
///              Button("About \(self.viewStore.appName)") {
///                self.viewStore.send(.aboutButtonTapped)
///              }
///            }
///          }
///        }
///      }
///      ```
///
///      Note that it is highly discouraged for you to observe _all_ of your root store's state.
///      It is almost never needed and will cause many view recomputations leading to poor
///      performance. This is why we construct a separate `SceneState` type that holds onto only the
///      state that the view needs for rendering. See <doc:Performance> for more information on this
///      topic.
///
/// If your view does not need access to any state in the store and only needs to be able to send
/// actions, then you should consider not using ``WithViewStore`` at all. Instead, you can send
/// actions to a ``Store`` in a lightweight way like so:
///
/// ```swift
/// Button("Tap me") {
///   ViewStore(self.store).send(.buttonTapped)
/// }
/// ```
