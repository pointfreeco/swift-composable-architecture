///
/// Reducers have 3 generics:
///
/// * `State`: A type that holds the current state of the application
/// * `Action`: A type that holds all possible actions that cause the state of the application to
///   change.
/// * `Environment`: A type that holds all dependencies needed in order to produce `Effect`s, such
///   as API clients, analytics clients, random number generators, etc.
///
/// - Note: The thread on which effects output is important. An effect's output is immediately sent
///   back into the store, and `Store` is not thread safe. This means all effects must receive
///   values on the same thread, **and** if the `Store` is being used to drive UI then all output
///   must be on the main thread. You can use the `Publisher` method `receive(on:)` for make the
///   effect output its values on the thread of your choice.

  /// you can make any changes to it directly inline. The reducer must return an effect, which
  /// typically would be constructed by using the dependencies inside the `environment` value. If
  /// no effect needs to be executed, a `.none` effect can be returned.
  ///
  /// For example:
  ///
  ///     struct MyState { var count = 0, text = "" }
