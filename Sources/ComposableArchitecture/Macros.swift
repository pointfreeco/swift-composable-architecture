  /// Helps implement the conformance to the ``Reducer`` protocol for a type.
  ///
  /// To use this macro you will define a new type, typically a struct, and add inner types for the
  /// ``Reducer/State`` and ``Reducer/Action`` associated types, as well as an implementation of the
  /// reducer's ``Reducer/body-8lumc``:
  ///
  /// ```swift
  /// @Reducer
  /// struct Feature {
  ///   struct State {
  ///     var count = 0
  ///   }
  ///   enum Action {
  ///     case decrementButtonTapped
  ///     case incrementButtonTapped
  ///   }
  ///   var body: some ReducerOf<Self> {
  ///     Reduce { state, action in
  ///       switch action {
  ///       case .decrementButtonTapped:
  ///         state.count -= 1
  ///         return .none
  ///       case .incrementButtonTapped:
  ///         state.count += 1
  ///         return .none
  ///       }
  ///     }
  ///   }
  /// }
  /// ```
  ///
  /// This will expand Swift code to conform `Feature` to the ``Reducer`` protocol:
  ///
  /// ```diff
  /// +extension Feature: Reducer {}
  /// ```
  ///
  /// It will also apply the `@CasePathable` macro to the `enum Action`:
  ///
  /// ```diff
  /// +@CasePathable
  ///  enum Action {
  ///    // ...
  ///  }
  /// ```
  ///
  /// This will allow you to use key path syntax for specifying enum cases in various APIs in the
  /// library, such as ``Reducer/ifLet(_:action:destination:fileID:line:)-4f2at``,
  /// ``Reducer/forEach(_:action:destination:fileID:line:)-yz3v``, ``Scope``, and more.
  ///
  /// Further, if the ``Reducer/State`` of your feature is an enum, which is useful for modeling a
  /// feature that can be one of multiple mutually exclusive values, the ``Reducer()`` will apply
  /// the `@CasePathable` macro, as well as `@dynamicMemberLookup`:
  ///
  /// ```diff
  /// +@CasePathable
  /// +@dynamicMemberLookup
  ///  enum State {
  ///    // ...
  ///  }
  /// ```
  ///
  /// This will allow you to use key path syntax for specifying case paths to the `State`'s cases,
  /// as well as allow you to use dot-chaining syntax for optionally extracting a case from the
  /// state. This can be useful when using the operators that come with the library that allow for
  /// driving navigation from an enum of options:
  ///
  /// ```swift
  /// .sheet(
  ///   item: $store.scope(state: \.destination?.editForm, action: \.destination.editForm)
  /// )
  /// ```
  ///
  /// The syntax `state: \.destination?.editForm` is only possible due to both
  /// `@dynamicMemberLookup` and `@CasePathable` being applied to the `State` enum.
  ///
  /// ## Automatic fulfillment of reducer requirements
  ///
  /// The ``Reducer()`` macro can automatically fill in the ``Reducer`` protocol's requirements for
  /// you. For example, something as simple as this:
  ///
  /// ```swift
  /// @Reducer
  /// struct Feature {
  /// }
  /// ```
  ///
  /// ‚Ä¶compiles.
  ///
  /// The `@Reducer` macro will automatically insert an empty ``Reducer/State`` struct, an empty
  /// ``Reducer/Action`` enum, and an empty ``Reducer/body-swift.property``. This effectively means
  /// that `Feature` is a logicless, behaviorless, inert reducer.
  ///
  /// Having these requirements automatically fulfilled for you can be handy for slowly
  /// filling them in with their real implementations. For example, this `Feature` reducer could be
  /// integrated in a parent domain using the library's navigation tools, all without having
  /// implemented any of the domain yet. Then, once we are ready we can start implementing the real
  /// logic and behavior of the feature.
  ///
  /// ## Destination and path reducers
  ///
  /// There is a common pattern in the Composable Architecture of representing destinations a 
  /// feature can navigate to as a reducer that operates on enum state, with a case for each
  /// feature that can be navigated to. This is explained in great detail in the
  /// <doc:TreeBasedNavigation> and <doc:StackBasedNavigation> articles.
  ///
  /// This form of domain modeling can be very powerful, but also incur a bit of boilerplate. For 
  /// example, if a feature can navigate to 3 other features, then one might have a `Destination`
  /// reducer like the following:
  ///
  /// ```swift
  /// @Reducer
  /// struct Destination {
  ///   @ObservableState
  ///   enum State {
  ///     case add(FormFeature.State)
  ///     case detail(DetailFeature.State)
  ///     case edit(EditFeature.State)
  ///   }
  ///   enum Action {
  ///     case add(FormFeature.Action)
  ///     case detail(DetailFeature.Action)
  ///     case edit(EditFeature.Action)
  ///   }
  ///   var body: some ReducerOf<Self> {
  ///     Scope(state: \.add, action: \.add) {
  ///       FormFeature()
  ///     }
  ///     Scope(state: \.detail, action: \.detail) {
  ///       DetailFeature()
  ///     }
  ///     Scope(state: \.edit, action: \.edit) {
  ///       EditFeature()
  ///     }
  ///   }
  /// }
  /// ```
  ///
  /// It's not the worst code in the world, but it is 24 lines with a lot of repetition, and if we 
  /// need to add a new destination we must add a case to the ``Reducer/State`` enum, a case to the
  /// ``Reducer/Action`` enum, and a ``Scope`` to the ``Reducer/body-swift.property``.
  ///
  /// The ``Reducer()`` macro is now capable of generating all of this code for you from the
  /// following simple declaration
  ///
  /// ```swift
  /// @Reducer
  /// enum Destination {
  ///   case add(FormFeature)
  ///   case detail(DetailFeature)
  ///   case edit(EditFeature)
  /// }
  /// ```
  ///
  /// 24 lines of code has become 6. The `@Reducer` macro can now be applied to an _enum_ where each
  /// case holds onto the reducer that governs the logic and behavior for that case. Further, when
  /// using the ``Reducer/ifLet(_:action:)`` operator with this style of `Destination` enum reducer
  /// you can completely leave off the trailing closure as it can be automatically inferred:
  ///
  /// ```swift
  /// Reduce { state, action in
  ///   // Core feature logic
  /// }
  /// .ifLet(\.$destination, action: \.destination)
  /// ```
  ///
  /// This pattern also works for `Path` reducers, which is common when dealing with
  /// <doc:StackBasedNavigation>, and in that case you can leave off the trailing closure of the
  /// ``Reducer/forEach(_:action:)`` operator:
  ///
  /// ```swift
  /// Reduce { state, action in
  ///   // Core feature logic
  /// }
  /// .forEach(\.path, action: \.path)
  /// ```
  ///
  /// ## Synthesizing protocol conformances on State and Action
  ///
  /// Since the `State` and `Action` types are generated automatically for you when using `@Reducer`
  /// on an enum, it's not possible to directly synthesize conformances of `Equatable`, `Hashable`,
  /// etc. on those types. And further, due to a bug in the Swift compiler you cannot currently
  /// do this:
  ///
  /// ```swift
  /// @Reducer
  /// enum Destination {
  ///   // ...
  /// }
  /// extension Destination.State: Equatable {}  // ‚ùå
  /// ```
  ///
  /// See <doc:Reducer()#Circular-reference-errors> below for more info on this error.
  ///
  /// So, to work around this compiler bug the `@Reducer` macro takes two
  /// ``ComposableArchitecture/_SynthesizedConformance`` arguments that allow you to describe which
  /// protocols you want to attach to the `State` or `Action` types:
  ///
  /// ```swift
  /// @Reducer(state: .equatable, .sendable, action: .sendable)
  /// enum Destination {
  ///   // ...
  /// }
  /// ```
  ///
  /// You can provide any combination of
/// ``ComposableArchitecture/_SynthesizedConformance/codable``,
/// ``ComposableArchitecture/_SynthesizedConformance/decodable``,
/// ``ComposableArchitecture/_SynthesizedConformance/encodable``,
/// ``ComposableArchitecture/_SynthesizedConformance/equatable``,
/// ``ComposableArchitecture/_SynthesizedConformance/hashable``, or
/// ``ComposableArchitecture/_SynthesizedConformance/sendable``.
  ///
  /// ## Gotchas
  ///
  /// ### Autocomplete
  ///
  /// Applying `@Reducer` can break autocompletion in the `body` of the reducer. This is a known
  /// [issue](https://github.com/apple/swift/issues/69477), and it can generally be worked around by
  /// providing additional type hints to the compiler:
  ///
  ///  1. Adding an explicit `Reducer` conformance in addition to the macro application can restore
  ///     autocomplete throughout the `body` of the reducer:
  ///
  ///     ```diff
  ///      @Reducer
  ///     -struct Feature {
  ///     +struct Feature: Reducer {
  ///     ```
  ///
  ///  2. Adding explicit generics to instances of `Reduce` in the `body` can restore autocomplete
  ///     inside the `Reduce`:
  ///
  ///     ```diff
  ///      var body: some Reducer<State, Action> {
  ///     -  Reduce { state, action in
  ///     +  Reduce<State, Action> { state, action in
  ///     ```
  ///
  /// ### Circular reference errors
  ///
  /// There is currently a bug in the Swift compiler and macros that prevents you from extending
  /// types that are inside other types with macros applied in the same file. For example, if you
  /// wanted to extend a reducer's `State` with some extra functionality:
  ///
  /// ```swift
  /// @Reducer
  /// struct Feature {
  ///   struct State { /* ... */ }
  ///   // ...
  /// }
  ///
  /// extension Feature.State {  // üõë Circular reference
  ///   // ...
  /// }
  /// ```
  ///
  /// This unfortunately does not work. It is a
  /// [known issue](https://github.com/apple/swift/issues/66450), and the only workaround is to
  /// either move the extension to a separate file, or move the code from the extension to be
  /// directly inside the `State` type.
  ///
  /// ### CI build failures
  ///
  /// When testing your code on an external CI server you may run into errors such as the following:
  ///
  /// > Error: CasePathsMacros Target 'CasePathsMacros' must be enabled before it can be used.
  /// >
  /// > ComposableArchitectureMacros Target 'ComposableArchitectureMacros' must be enabled
  /// before it can be used.
  ///
  /// You can fix this in one of two ways. You can write a default to the CI machine that allows
  /// Xcode to skip macro validation:
  ///
  /// ```shell
  /// defaults write com.apple.dt.Xcode IDESkipMacroFingerprintValidation -bool YES
  /// ```
  ///
  /// Or if you are invoking `xcodebuild` directly in your CI scripts, you can pass the
  ///  `-skipMacroValidation` flag to `xcodebuild` when building your project:
  ///
  /// ```shell
  /// xcodebuild -skipMacroValidation ‚Ä¶
  /// ```
