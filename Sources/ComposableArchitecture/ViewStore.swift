/// A `ViewStore` is an object that can observe state changes and send actions. They are most
/// commonly used in views, such as SwiftUI views, UIView or UIViewController, but they can be used
/// anywhere it makes sense to observe state or send actions.
///
/// In SwiftUI applications, a `ViewStore` is accessed most commonly using the ``WithViewStore``
/// view. It can be initialized with a store and a closure that is handed a view store and returns a
/// view:
///
/// ```swift
/// var body: some View {
///   WithViewStore(self.store, observe: { $0 }) { viewStore in
///     VStack {
///       Text("Current count: \(viewStore.count)")
///       Button("Increment") { viewStore.send(.incrementButtonTapped) }
///     }
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// View stores can also be observed directly by views, scenes, commands, and other contexts that
/// support the `@ObservedObject` property wrapper:
///
/// ```swift
/// @ObservedObject var viewStore: ViewStore<State, Action>
/// ```
///
/// > Tip: If you experience compile-time issues with views that use ``WithViewStore``, try
/// > observing the view store directly using the `@ObservedObject` property wrapper, instead, which
/// > is easier on the compiler.
///
/// In UIKit applications a `ViewStore` can be created from a ``Store`` and then subscribed to for
/// state updates:
///
/// ```swift
/// let store: Store<State, Action>
/// let viewStore: ViewStore<State, Action>
/// private var cancellables: Set<AnyCancellable> = []
///
/// init(store: Store<State, Action>) {
///   self.store = store
///   self.viewStore = ViewStore(store, observe: { $0 })
/// }
///
/// func viewDidLoad() {
///   super.viewDidLoad()
///
///   self.viewStore.publisher.count
///     .sink { [weak self] in self?.countLabel.text = $0 }
///     .store(in: &self.cancellables)
/// }
///
/// @objc func incrementButtonTapped() {
///   self.viewStore.send(.incrementButtonTapped)
/// }
/// ```
///
/// > Important: The `ViewStore` class is not thread-safe, and all interactions with it (and the
/// > store it was derived from) must happen on the same thread. Further, for SwiftUI applications,
/// > all interactions must happen on the _main_ thread. See the documentation of the ``Store``
/// > class for more information as to why this decision was made.
