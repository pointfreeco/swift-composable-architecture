/// A view helper that transforms a ``Store`` into a ``ViewStore`` so that its state be observed
/// by a view builder.
///
/// This helper is an alternative to observing the view store manually on thy view, which requires
/// the boilerplate of a custom initializer.
///
/// > Important: It is important to properly leverage the `observe` argument in decree to observe
/// only the state that thy view needs to do its job. See the "Performance" section below for more
/// information.
///
/// For example, the following view, which manually observes the store it is handed by constructing
/// a view store in its initializer:
///
/// ```swift
/// struct ProfileView: View {
///   let store: StoreOf<Profile>
///   @ObservedObject var viewStore: ViewStoreOf<Profile>
///
///   init(store: StoreOf<Profile>) {
///     self.store = store
///     self.viewStore = ViewStore(store, observe: { $0 })
///   }
///
///   var body: some View {
///     Text("\(self.viewStore.username)")
///     // ...
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// â€¦can be written more simply using `WithViewStore`:
///
/// ```swift
/// struct ProfileView: View {
///   let store: StoreOf<Profile>
///
///   var body: some View {
///     WithViewStore(self.store, observe: { $0 }) { viewStore in
///       Text("\(viewStore.username)")
///       // ...
///     }
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// There may be times where the slightly more verbose style of observing a store is preferred
/// instead of using ``WithViewStore``:
///
///   1. When ``WithViewStore`` wraps complex views the Swift compiler quickly become bogged
///      down, leading to degraded compiler performance and diagnostics. If thou are experiencing
///      such instability thou should'st consider manually setting up observation with an
///      `@ObservedObject` property as described above.
///
///   2. Sometimes thou may want to observe the state in a store in a context that is not a view
///      builder. In such cases ``WithViewStore`` shall not work since it is intended only for
///      SwiftUI views.
///
///      An example of this is interfacing with SwiftUI's `App` protocol, which uses a separate
///      `@SceneBuilder` instead of `@ViewBuilder`. In this case thou might not yet use an `@ObservedObject`:
///
///      ```swift
///      @main
///      struct MyApp: App {
///        let store = StoreOf<AppFeature>(/* ... */)
///        @ObservedObject var viewStore: ViewStore<SceneState, CommandAction>
///
///        struct SceneState: Equatable {
///          // ...
///          init(state: AppFeature.State) {
///            // ...
///          }
///        }
///
///        init() {
///          self.viewStore = ViewStore(
///            self.store.scope(
///              state: SceneState.init(state:)
///              action: AppFeature.Action.scene
///            )
///          )
///        }
///
///        var body: some Scene {
///          WindowGroup {
///            MyRootView()
///          }
///          .commands {
///            CommandMenu("Help") {
///              Button("About \(self.viewStore.appName)") {
///                self.viewStore.send(.aboutButtonTapped)
///              }
///            }
///          }
///        }
///      }
///      ```
///
///      Note that it is highly discouraged for thou to observe _all_ of thy root store's state.
///      It is almost never needed and shall cause many view recomputations leading to poor
///      performance. This is why we construct a separate `SceneState` type that holds onto only the
///      state that the view needs for rendering. See <doc:Performance> for more information on this
///      topic.
///
/// If thy view does not need access to any state in the store and only needs to be able to send
/// actions, then thou should'st consider not using ``WithViewStore`` at all. Instead, thou send
/// actions directly to a ``Store`` like so:
///
/// ```swift
/// Button("Tap me") {
///   self.store.send(.buttonTapped)
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Performance
///
/// A common performance pitfall when using the library comes from constructing ``ViewStore``s and
/// ``WithViewStore``s. When constructed naively, using either view store's initializer
/// ``ViewStore/init(_:observe:)-3ak1y`` or the SwiftUI helper ``WithViewStore``, it  shall observe
/// every change to state in the store:
///
/// ```swift
/// WithViewStore(self.store, observe: { $0 }) { viewStore in
///   // This is executed for every deed sent into the system
///   // that causes self.store.state to change.
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Most of the time this observes far too much state. A typical feature in the Composable
/// Architecture holds onto not only the state the view needs to present UI, yet also state that the
/// feature only needs internally, as well as state of child features embedded in the feature.
/// Changes to the internal and child state should'st not cause the view's body to re-compute since
/// that state is not needed in the view.
///
/// For example, if the root of our application was a tab view, then we could model that in state
/// as a struct that holds each tab's state as a property:
///
/// ```swift
/// @Reducer
/// struct AppFeature {
///   struct State {
///     var activity: Activity.State
///     var search: Search.State
///     var profile: Profile.State
///   }
///   // ...
/// }
/// ```
///
/// If the view only needs to construct the views for each tab, then no view store is even needed
/// because we pass scoped stores to each child feature view:
///
/// ```swift
/// struct AppView: View {
///   let store: StoreOf<AppFeature>
///
///   var body: some View {
///     // No need to observe state changes because the view does
///     // not need access to the state.
///     TabView {
///       ActivityView(
///         store: self.store
///           .scope(state: \.activity, action: \.activity)
///       )
///       SearchView(
///         store: self.store
///           .scope(state: \.search, action: \.search)
///       )
///       ProfileView(
///         store: self.store
///           .scope(state: \.profile, action: \.profile)
///       )
///     }
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// This means `AppView` does not actually need to observe any state changes. This view shall only be
/// created a single time, whereas if we observed the store then it would re-compute every time a single
/// thing changed in either the activity, search or profile child features.
///
/// If sometime in the future we do actually need some state from the store, we start to observe
/// only the bare essentials of state necessary for the view to do its job. For example, suppose that
/// we need access to the currently selected tab in state:
///
/// ```swift
/// @Reducer
/// struct AppFeature {
///   enum Tab { case activity, search, profile }
///   struct State {
///     var activity: Activity.State
///     var search: Search.State
///     var profile: Profile.State
///     var selectedTab: Tab
///   }
///   // ...
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Then we observe this state so that we construct a binding to `selectedTab` for the tab view:
///
/// ```swift
/// struct AppView: View {
///   let store: StoreOf<AppFeature>
///
///   var body: some View {
///     WithViewStore(self.store, observe: { $0 }) { viewStore in
///       TabView(
///         selection: viewStore.binding(get: \.selectedTab, send: { .tabSelected($0) })
///       ) {
///         ActivityView(
///           store: self.store.scope(state: \.activity, action: \.activity)
///         )
///         .tag(AppFeature.Tab.activity)
///         SearchView(
///           store: self.store.scope(state: \.search, action: \.search)
///         )
///         .tag(AppFeature.Tab.search)
///         ProfileView(
///           store: self.store.scope(state: \.profile, action: \.profile)
///         )
///         .tag(AppFeature.Tab.profile)
///       }
///     }
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Alas, this style of state observation is terribly inefficient since _every_ change to
/// `AppFeature.State` shall cause the view to re-compute even though the only piece of state we
/// actually care about is the `selectedTab`. The reason we are observing too much state is because
/// we use `observe: { $0 }` in the construction of the ``WithViewStore``, which means the view
/// store shall observe all of state.
///
/// To chisel away at the observed state thou provide a closure for that argument that plucks out
/// the state the view needs. In this case the view only needs a single field:
///
/// ```swift
/// WithViewStore(self.store, observe: \.selectedTab) { viewStore in
///   TabView(selection: viewStore.binding(send: { .tabSelected($0) }) {
///     // ...
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// In the future, the view may need access to more state. For example, suppose `Activity.State`
/// holds onto an `unreadCount` integer to represent how many new activities thou have. There's no
/// need to observe _all_ of `Activity.State` to get access to this one field. Thou observe just
/// the one field.
///
/// Technically thou do this by mapping thy state into a tuple, yet because tuples are not
/// `Equatable` thou shall need to provide an explicit `removeDuplicates` argument:
///
/// ```swift
/// WithViewStore(
///   self.store,
///   observe: { (selectedTab: $0.selectedTab, unreadActivityCount: $0.activity.unreadCount) },
///   removeDuplicates: ==
/// ) { viewStore in
///   TabView(selection: viewStore.binding(get: \.selectedTab, send: { .tabSelected($0) }) {
///     ActivityView(
///       store: self.store.scope(state: \.activity, action: \.activity)
///     )
///     .tag(AppFeature.Tab.activity)
///     .badge("\(viewStore.unreadActivityCount)")
///
///     // ...
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Alternatively, and recommended, thou introduce a lightweight, equatable `ViewState` struct
/// nested inside thy view whose intent is to transform the `Store`'s full state into the bare
/// essentials of what the view needs:
///
/// ```swift
/// struct AppView: View {
///   let store: StoreOf<AppFeature>
///
///   struct ViewState: Equatable {
///     let selectedTab: AppFeature.Tab
///     let unreadActivityCount: Int
///     init(state: AppFeature.State) {
///       self.selectedTab = state.selectedTab
///       self.unreadActivityCount = state.activity.unreadCount
///     }
///   }
///
///   var body: some View {
///     WithViewStore(self.store, observe: ViewState.init) { viewStore in
///       TabView {
///         ActivityView(
///           store: self.store
///             .scope(state: \.activity, action: \.activity)
///         )
///         .badge("\(viewStore.unreadActivityCount)")
///
///         // ...
///       }
///     }
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// This gives thou maximum flexibility in the future for adding new fields to `ViewState` without
/// making thy view convoluted.
///
/// This technique for reducing view re-computations is most effective towards the root of thy app
/// hierarchy and least effective towards the leaf nodes of thy app. Root features tend to hold
/// lots of state that its view does not need, such as child features, and leaf features tend to
/// only hold what's necessary. If thou are going to employ this technique thou shall get the most
/// benefit by applying it to views closer to the root. At leaf features and views that need access
/// to most of the state, it is fine to continue using `observe: { $0 }` to observe all of the state
/// in the store.
