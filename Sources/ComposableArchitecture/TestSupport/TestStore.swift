  /// A testable runtime for a reducer.
  ///
  /// This object aids in writing expressive and exhaustive tests for features built in the
  /// Composable Architecture. It allows you to send a sequence of actions to the store, and each
  /// step of the way you must assert exactly how state changed, and how effect emissions were fed
  /// back into the system.
  ///
  /// There are multiple ways the test store forces you to exhaustively assert on how your feature
  /// behaves:
  ///
  /// * After each action is sent you must describe precisely how the state changed from before the
  ///   action was sent to after it was sent.
  ///
  ///   If even the smallest piece of data differs the test will fail. This guarantees that you are
  ///   proving you know precisely how the state of the system changes.
  ///
  /// * Sending an action can sometimes cause an effect to be executed, and if that effect emits an
  ///   action that is fed back into the system, you **must** explicitly assert that you expect to
  ///   receive that action from the effect, _and_ you must assert how state changed as a result.
  ///
  ///   If you try to send another action before you have handled all effect emissions the assertion
  ///   will fail. This guarantees that you do not accidentally forget about an effect emission, and
  ///   that the sequence of steps you are describing will mimic how the application behaves in
  ///   reality.
  ///
  /// * All effects must complete by the time the assertion has finished running the steps you
  ///   specify.
  ///
  ///   If at the end of the assertion there is still an in-flight effect running, the assertion
  ///   will fail. This helps exhaustively prove that you know what effects are in flight and forces
  ///   you to prove that effects will not cause any future changes to your state.
  ///
  /// For example, given a simple counter reducer:
  ///
  ///     struct CounterState {
  ///       var count = 0
  ///     }
  ///
  ///     enum CounterAction: Equatable {
  ///       case decrementButtonTapped
  ///       case incrementButtonTapped
  ///     }
  ///
  ///     let counterReducer = Reducer<CounterState, CounterAction, Void> { state, action, _ in
  ///       switch action {
  ///       case .decrementButtonTapped:
  ///         state.count -= 1
  ///         return .none
  ///
  ///       case .incrementButtonTapped:
  ///         state.count += 1
  ///         return .none
  ///       }
  ///     }
  ///
  /// One can assert against its behavior over time:
  ///
  ///     class CounterTests: XCTestCase {
  ///       func testCounter() {
  ///         let store = TestStore(
  ///           initialState: .init(count: 0),  // GIVEN counter state of 0
  ///           reducer: counterReducer,
  ///           environment: ()
  ///         )
  ///
  ///         store.assert(
  ///           .send(.incrementButtonTapped) { // WHEN the increment button is tapped
  ///             $0.count = 1                  // THEN the count should be 1
  ///           }
  ///         )
  ///       }
  ///     }
  ///
  /// Note that in the trailing closure of `.send(.incrementButtonTapped)` we are given a single
  /// mutable value of the state before the action was sent, and it is our job to mutate the value
  /// to match the state after the action was sent. In this case the `count` field changes to `1`.
  ///
  /// For a more complex example, consider the following bare-bones search feature that uses the
  /// `.debounce` operator to wait for the user to stop typing before making a network request:
  ///
  ///     struct SearchState: Equatable {
  ///       var query = ""
  ///       var results: [String] = []
  ///     }
  ///
  ///     enum SearchAction: Equatable {
  ///       case queryChanged(String)
  ///       case response([String])
  ///     }
  ///
  ///     struct SearchEnvironment {
  ///       var mainQueue: AnySchedulerOf<DispatchQueue>
  ///       var request: (String) -> Effect<[String], Never>
  ///     }
  ///
  ///     let searchReducer = Reducer<SearchState, SearchAction, SearchEnvironment> {
  ///       state, action, environment in
  ///
  ///         struct SearchId: Hashable {}
  ///
  ///         switch action {
  ///         case let .queryChanged(query):
  ///           state.query = query
  ///           return environment.request(self.query)
  ///             .debounce(id: SearchId(), for: 0.5, scheduler: environment.mainQueue)
  ///
  ///         case let .response(results):
