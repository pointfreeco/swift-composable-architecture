/// A testable runtime for a reducer.
///
/// This object aids in writing expressive and exhaustive tests for features built in the
/// Composable Architecture. It allows you to send a sequence of actions to the store, and each
/// step of the way you must assert exactly how state changed, and how effect emissions were fed
/// back into the system.
///
/// See the dedicated <doc:Testing> article for detailed information on testing.
///
/// ## Exhaustive testing
///
/// There are multiple ways the test store forces you to exhaustively assert on how your feature
/// behaves:
///
///   * After each action is sent you must describe precisely how the state changed from before
///     the action was sent to after it was sent.
///
///     If even the smallest piece of data differs the test will fail. This guarantees that you
///     are proving you know precisely how the state of the system changes.
///
///   * Sending an action can sometimes cause an effect to be executed, and if that effect emits
///     an action that is fed back into the system, you **must** explicitly assert that you expect
///     to receive that action from the effect, _and_ you must assert how state changed as a
///     result.
///
///     If you try to send another action before you have handled all effect emissions the
///     assertion will fail. This guarantees that you do not accidentally forget about an effect
///     emission, and that the sequence of steps you are describing will mimic how the application
///     behaves in reality.
///
///   * All effects must complete by the time the assertion has finished running the steps you
///     specify, and all effect actions must be asserted on.
///
///     If at the end of the assertion there is still an in-flight effect running or an unreceived
///     action, the assertion will fail. This helps exhaustively prove that you know what effects
///     are in flight and forces you to prove that effects will not cause any future changes to
///     your state.
///
/// For example, given a simple counter reducer:
///
/// ```swift
/// struct Counter: ReducerProtocol {
///   struct State: Equatable {
///     var count = 0
///   }
///
///   enum Action {
///     case decrementButtonTapped
///     case incrementButtonTapped
///   }
///
///   func reduce(
///     into state: inout State, action: Action
///   ) -> EffectTask<Action> {
///     switch action {
///     case .decrementButtonTapped:
///       state.count -= 1
///       return .none
///
///     case .incrementButtonTapped:
///       state.count += 1
///       return .none
///     }
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// One can assert against its behavior over time:
///
/// ```swift
/// @MainActor
/// class CounterTests: XCTestCase {
///   func testCounter() async {
///     let store = TestStore(
///       // Given a counter state of 0
///       initialState: Counter.State(count: 0),
///       reducer: Counter()
///     )
///
///     // When the increment button is tapped
///     await store.send(.incrementButtonTapped) {
///       // Then the count should be 1
///       $0.count = 1
///     }
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Note that in the trailing closure of `.send(.incrementButtonTapped)` we are given a single
/// mutable value of the state before the action was sent, and it is our job to mutate the value
/// to match the state after the action was sent. In this case the `count` field changes to `1`.
///
/// If the change made in the closure does not reflect reality, you will get a test failure with
/// a nicely formatted failure message letting you know exactly what went wrong:
///
/// ```swift
/// await store.send(.incrementButtonTapped) {
///   $0.count = 42
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ```
/// 🛑 A state change does not match expectation: …
///
///      TestStoreFailureTests.State(
///     −   count: 42
///     +   count: 1
///      )
///
/// (Expected: −, Actual: +)
/// ```
///
/// For a more complex example involving effects, consider the following bare-bones search feature
/// that uses an API client to search when a text field changes:
///
/// ```swift
/// struct Search: ReducerProtocol {
///   struct State: Equatable {
///     var query = ""
///     var results: [String] = []
///   }
///
///   enum Action: Equatable {
///     case queryChanged(String)
///     case searchResponse(TaskResult<[String]>)
///   }
///
///   @Dependency(\.apiClient) var apiClient
///
///   func reduce(
///     into state: inout State, action: Action
///   ) -> EffectTask<Action> {
///     switch action {
///     case let .queryChanged(query):
///       enum SearchID {}
///
///       state.query = query
///       return .task { [query] in
///         await .searchResponse(
///           TaskResult {
///             try await self.apiClient.search(query)
///           }
///         )
///       }
///
///     case let .searchResponse(.success(results)):
///       state.results = results
///       return .none
///
///     case .searchResponse(.failure):
///       // Do error handling here.
///       return .none
///     }
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// It can be fully tested by overriding the `apiClient` dependency with values that are fully
/// controlled and deterministic:
///
/// ```swift
/// let store = TestStore(
///   initialState: Search.State(),
///   reducer: Search()
/// )
///
/// // Simulate a search response with one item
/// store.dependencies.mainQueue.apiClient.search = { _ in
///   ["Composable Architecture"]
/// }
///
/// // Change the query
/// await store.send(.searchFieldChanged("c") {
///   $0.query = "c"
/// }
///
/// // Assert that the expected response is received
/// await store.receive(.searchResponse(.success(["Composable Architecture"]))) {
///   $0.results = ["Composable Architecture"]
/// }
/// ```
///
/// This test is proving that when the search query changes some search responses are delivered
/// and state updates accordingly.
///
/// If we did not assert that the `searchResponse` action was received, we would get the following
/// test failure:
///
/// ```
/// 🛑 The store received 1 unexpected action after this one: …
///
///     Unhandled actions: [
///       [0]: Search.Action.seachResponse
///     ]
/// ```
///
/// This helpfully lets us know that we have no asserted on everything that happened in the feature,
/// which could be hiding a bug from us.
///
/// Or if we had sent another action before handling the effect's action we would have also gotten
/// a test failure:
///
/// ```
/// 🛑 Must handle 1 received action before sending an action: …
///
///     Unhandled actions: [
///       [0]: Search.Action.seachResponse
///     ]
/// ```
///
/// All of these types of failures help you prove that you know exactly how your feature evolves
/// as actions are sent into the system. If the library did not produce a test failure in these
/// situations it could be hiding subtle bugs in your code. For example, when the user clears the
/// search query you probably expect that the results are cleared and no search request is executed
/// since there is no query. This can be done like so:
///
/// ```swift
/// store.send(.queryChanged("")) {
///   $0.query = ""
///   $0.results = []
/// }
///
/// // No need to perform `store.receive` since you do not expect a search
/// // effect to execute.
/// ```
///
/// But, if in the future a bug is introduced causing a search request to be executed even when the
/// query is empty, you will get a test failure because a new effect is being created that is
/// not being asserted on. This is the power of exhaustive testing.
///
/// ## Non-exhaustive testing
///
/// While exhaustive testing can be powerful, it can also be a nuisance, especially when testing
/// how many features integrate together. This is why sometimes you may want to selectively test
/// in a non-exhaustive style.
///
/// > Tip: The concept of "non-exhaustive test store" was first introduced by
/// [Krzysztof Zabłocki][merowing.info] in a [blog post][exhaustive-testing-in-tca] and
/// [conference talk][Composable-Architecture-at-Scale], and then later became integrated into the
/// core library.
///
/// Test stores are exhaustive by default, which means you must assert on every state change, and
/// how ever effect feeds data back into the system, and you must make sure that all effects
/// complete before the test is finished. To turn of exhaustivity you can set ``exhaustivity``
/// to ``Exhaustivity/none``. When that is done the ``TestStore``'s behavior changes:
///
/// * The trailing closures of ``send(_:_:file:line:)-6s1gq`` and
/// ``receive(_:timeout:_:file:line:)`` no longer need to assert on all state changes. They
/// can assert on any subset of changes, and only if they make an incorrect mutation will a test
/// failure be raised.
/// * The ``send(_:_:file:line:)-6s1gq`` and ``receive(_:timeout:_:file:line:)`` methods are
/// allowed to be called even when actions have been received from effects that have not been
/// asserted on yet. Any pending actions will be cleared.
/// * Tests are allowed to finish with unasserted, received actions and inflight effects. No test
/// failures will be raised.
///
/// There is also a third option between full and no exhaustivity called ``Exhaustivity/partial``.
/// When it is set the test store behaves like when ``Exhaustivity/none`` is set, but with the added
/// behavior that any unasserted change causes a grey, informational box to appear next to each
/// assertion detailing the changes that were not asserted against. This allows you to see what
/// information you are choosing to ignore without causing a test failure. It can be useful in
/// tracking down bugs that happen in production but that aren't currently detected in tests.
///
/// This style of testing is most useful for testing the integration of multiple features where you want
/// to focus on just a certain slice of the behavior. Exhaustive testing can still be important to use
/// for leaf node features, where you truly do want to assert on everything happening inside the
/// feature.
///
/// For example, suppose you have a tab-based application where the 3rd tab is a login screen. The user
/// can fill in some data on the screen, then tap the "Submit" button, and then a series of events
/// happens to  log the user in. Once the user is logged in, the 3rd tab switches from a login screen
/// to a profile screen, _and_ the selected tab switches to the first tab, which is an activity screen.
///
/// When writing tests for the login feature we will want to do that in the exhaustive style so that we
/// can prove exactly how the feature would behave in production. But, suppose we wanted to write an
/// integration test that proves after the user taps the "Login" button that ultimately the selected
/// tab switches to the first tab.
///
/// In order to test such a complex flow we must test the integration of multiple features, which means
/// dealing with complex, nested state and effects. We can emulate this flow in a test by sending
/// actions that mimic the user logging in, and then eventually assert that the selected tab switched
/// to activity:
///
/// ```swift
/// let store = TestStore(
///   initialState: App.State(),
///   reducer: App()
/// )
///
/// // 1️⃣ Emulate user tapping on submit button.
/// await store.send(.login(.submitButtonTapped)) {
///   $0.isLoading = true
/// }
///
/// // 2️⃣ Login feature performs API request to login, and
/// //    sends response back into system.
/// await store.receive(.login(.loginResponse(.success))) {
///   $0.isLoading = false
/// }
///
/// // 3️⃣ Login feature sends a delegate action to let parent
/// //    feature know it has successfully logged in.
/// await store.receive(.login(.delegate(.didLogin))) {
///   // 4️⃣ Assert how all of app state changes due to that action.
///   $0.authenticatedTab = .loggedIn(
///     Profile.State(...)
///   )
///   // 4️⃣ *Finally* assert that the selected tab switches to activity.
///   $0.selectedTab = .activity
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Doing this with exhaustive testing is verbose, and there are a few problems with this:
///
/// * We need to be intimately knowledgeable in how the login feature works so that we can assert
/// on how its state changes and how its effects feed data back into the system.
/// * If the login feature were to change its logic we may get test failures here even though the logic
/// we are acutally trying to test doesn't really care about those changes.
/// * This test is very long, and so if there are other similar but slightly different flows we want to
/// test we will be tempted to copy-and-paste the whole thing, leading to lots of duplicated, fragile
/// tests.
///
/// Non-exhaustive testing allows us to test the high-level flow that we are concerned with, that of
/// login causing the selected tab to switch to activity, without having to worry about what is
/// happening inside the login feature. To do this, we can turn off ``TestStore/exhaustivity`` in the
/// test store, and then just assert on what we are interested in:
///
/// ```swift
/// let store = TestStore(
///   initialState: App.State(),
///   reducer: App()
/// )
/// store.exhaustivity = .none // ⬅️
///
/// await store.send(.login(.submitButtonTapped))
/// await store.receive(.login(.delegate(.didLogin))) {
///   $0.selectedTab = .activity
/// }
/// ```
///
/// In particular, we did not assert on how the login's state changed or how the login's effects fed
/// data back into the system. We just assert that when the "Submit" button is tapped that eventually
/// we get the `didLogin` delegate action and that causes the selected tab to flip to activity. Now
/// the login feature is free to make any change it wants to make without affecting this integration
/// test.
///
/// Using ``Exhaustivity/none`` for ``TestStore/exhaustivity`` causes all un-asserted changes to pass
/// without any notification. If you would like to see what test failures are being supressed without
/// actually causing a failure, you can use ``Exhaustivity/partial``:
///
/// ```swift
/// let store = TestStore(
///   initialState: App.State(),
///   reducer: App()
/// )
/// store.exhaustivity = .partial // ⬅️
///
/// await store.send(.login(.submitButtonTapped))
/// await store.receive(.login(.delegate(.didLogin))) {
///   $0.selectedTab = .profile
/// }
/// ```
///
/// When this is run you will get grey, informational boxes on each assertion where some change wasn't
/// fully asserted on:
///
/// ```
/// ◽️ A state change does not match expectation: …
///
///      App.State(
///        authenticatedTab: .loggedOut(
///          Login.State(
///    −       isLoading: false
///    +       isLoading: true,
///            …
///          )
///        )
///      )
///
///    (Expected: −, Actual: +)
///
/// ◽️ Skipped receiving .login(.loginResponse(.success))
///
/// ◽️ A state change does not match expectation: …
///
///      App.State(
///    −   authenticatedTab: .loggedOut(…)
///    +   authenticatedTab: .loggedIn(
///    +     Profile.State(…)
///    +   ),
///        …
///      )
///
///    (Expected: −, Actual: +)
/// ```
///
/// The test still passes, and none of these notifications are test failures. They just let you know
/// what things you are not explicitly asserting against, and can be useful to see when tracking down
/// bugs that happen in production but that aren't currently detected in tests.

        • If an effect uses a scheduler (via "receive(on:)", "delay", "debounce", etc.), make \
        sure that you wait enough time for the scheduler to perform the effect. If you are using \
        a test scheduler, advance the scheduler so that the effects may complete, or consider \
        using an immediate scheduler to immediately perform the effect instead.

        • If you are returning a long-living effect (timers, notifications, subjects, etc.), \
        then make sure those effects are torn down by marking the effect ".cancellable" and \
        returning a corresponding cancellation effect ("Effect.cancel") from another action, or, \
        if your effect is driven by a Combine subject, send it a completion.
