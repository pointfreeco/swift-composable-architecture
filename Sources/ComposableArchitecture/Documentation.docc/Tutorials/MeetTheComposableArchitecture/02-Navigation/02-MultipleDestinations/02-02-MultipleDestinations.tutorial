@Tutorial(time: 30) {
  @Intro(title: "Multiple presentation destinations") {
    In the previous section you learned how model your domains so that a parent feature can 
    present a child feature. Now let's learn what has to be done if a parent feature wants to be
    able to present _many_ features.
  }
  
  @Section(title: "Delete contacts") {
    @ContentAndMedia {
      Let's add a new feature to the contacts list that allows you to delete a contact, but first
      you must confirm deletion. We will implement the confirmation step using an alert. The tools
      that we used last section, such as ``ComposableArchitecture/PresentationState``,
      ``ComposableArchitecture/PresentationAction`` and `ifLet`, all work for presenting alerts 
      from optional state too.
    }
    
    @Steps {
      @Step {
        Go back to ContactsFeature.swift that we worked in from the last section. Add a new action
        that will be sent when the delete button is tapped on a row in the contacts list.
        
        @Code(name: "ContactsFeatures.swift", file: 02-02-01-code-0000, previousFile: 02-02-01-code-0000-previous)
      }
      
      When the delete button is tapped we want to show an alert asking the user to confirm deletion
      of the contact.
      
      @Step {
        Add a piece of optional ``ComposableArchitecture/PresentationState`` state to the 
        `ContactsFeature` state. We will further use `AlertState` as it allows us to describe all
        of the details of the alert in a manner that is test friendly since it is `Equatable`.
        
        @Code(name: "ContactsFeatures.swift", file: 02-02-01-code-0001)
      }
      
      @Step {
        Add a new case to the `ContactsFeature`'s action that represents the actions that can 
        happen in the alert. We will use ``ComposableArchitecture/PresentationAction`` for this.
        
        > Note: The only choices in the alert are to cancel or confirm deletion, but we do not need 
        to model the cancel action. That will be handled automatically for us.
        
        @Code(name: "ContactsFeatures.swift", file: 02-02-01-code-0002)
      }
      
      Now that we have new state modeled in our domain for the presentation of the alert, we can
      properly implement the `deleteButtonTapped` action.
      
      @Step {
        When the delete button is tapped we can populate the `alert` state in order to ask the user
        to confirm deletion of the contact.
        
        @Code(name: "ContactsFeatures.swift", file: 02-02-01-code-0003)
      }
      
      @Step {
        Integrate the alert's logic into the `ContactsFeature` by making another use of the 
        ``ComposableArchitecture/Reducer/ifLet(_:action:destination:fileID:line:)`` operator.
        
        @Code(name: "ContactsFeatures.swift", file: 02-02-01-code-0004)
      }
      
      @Step {
        Listen for when the confirmation action is sent in the alert, and at that time we can
        actually remove the element from the array.
        
        @Code(name: "ContactsFeatures.swift", file: 02-02-01-code-0005)
      }
      
      That's all it takes to integrate the alert it the `ContactsFeature` and implement all of its 
      logic. Next we need to integrate the alert into the view. Just as the library ships a special
      `sheet(store:)` view modifier that is tuned specifically for 
      ``ComposableArchitecture/Store``s, it also comes with a `alert(store:)` that serves a similar
      purpose.
      
      @Step {
        Add the `alert(store:)` view modifier to the `ContactsView`, and hand it a store that is
        scoped to the alert domain.
        
        @Code(name: "ContactsFeatures.swift", file: 02-02-01-code-0006, previousFile: 02-02-01-code-0006-previous)
      }
      
      @Step {
        Add a button to each row of the contacts list in order to send the `deleteButtonTapped`
        action to the view store.
        
        @Code(name: "ContactsFeatures.swift", file: 02-02-01-code-0007)
      }
      
      @Step {
        Run the app in the preview to see that deletion works as expected. After tapping the trash
        icon, an alert shows, and if you confirm deletion the item is removed from the list.
        
        @Video(source: "ch02-sub02-sec01-0000")
      }
      
      We've now added a new feature, that of deleting a contact, but unfortunately our domain
      is not modeled as concisely as it could be.
    }
  }
  
  @Section(title: "Improve domain modeling") {
    @ContentAndMedia {
      Currently the `ContactsFeature` can navigate to two possible destinations: either the "Add
      Contact" sheet or the delete alert. Importantly, it is not possible to be navigated to both
      destinations at once. However, that currently is possible since we are representing each of
      those destinations as optional pieces of ``ComposableArchitecture/PresentationState``.
      
      The number of invalid states explodes exponentially when you use optionals to represent
      features you can navigate to. For example, 2 optionals has 1 invalid state, but 3 optionals
      has 4 invalid states, and 4 optionals has 11 invalid states. This imprecise domain modeling
      leaks complexity into your application since you can never truly know which feature is being
      presented.
      
      Let's see how to more concisely model our domains for navigating to multiple destinations.
    }
    
    @Steps {
      @Step {
        Define a new reducer, called `Destination`, nested inside the `ContactsFeature`. This 
        reducer will hold the domain and logic for every feature that can be navigated to from
        the contacts feature.
        
        @Code(name: "ContactsFeatures.swift", file: 02-02-02-code-0000)
      }
      
      @Step {
        Implement the `State` requirement as an enum because we want to express the fact that only
        one single destination can be active at a time, and enums are perfect for that.
        
        @Code(name: "ContactsFeatures.swift", file: 02-02-02-code-0001)
      }
      
      @Step {
        Add a case to the `State` enum for each destination feature that can be navigated to, and
        hold onto that feature's state. Right now this includes the `AddContactFeature` and the 
        alert.
        
        @Code(name: "ContactsFeatures.swift", file: 02-02-02-code-0002)
      }
      
      @Step {
        Implement the `Action` requirement as an enum. 
        
        @Code(name: "ContactsFeatures.swift", file: 02-02-02-code-0003)
      }
      
      @Step {
        Add a case to the `Action` enum for each destination feature that can be navigated to, and
        hold onto that feature's action.
        
        @Code(name: "ContactsFeatures.swift", file: 02-02-02-code-0004)
      }
      
      @Step {
        Implement the ``ComposableArchitecture/Reducer/body-swift.property`` of the reducer.
        
        @Code(name: "ContactsFeatures.swift", file: 02-02-02-code-0005)
      }
      
      @Step {
        Compose all of the destination features together by using the 
        ``ComposableArchitecture/Scope`` reducer to focus on the domain of a reducer. Typically
        you will need one ``ComposableArchitecture/Scope`` reducer for each destination except for
        alerts and confirmation dialogs since they do not have a reducer of their own.
        
        @Code(name: "ContactsFeatures.swift", file: 02-02-02-code-0006)
      }
      
      @Step {
        Replace the two pieces of optional ``ComposableArchitecture/PresentationState`` with a 
        single option pointed at `Destination.State`.
        
        @Code(name: "ContactsFeatures.swift", file: 02-02-02-code-0007, previousFile: 02-02-02-code-0007-previous)
      }
      
      @Step {
        Replace the two action cases that held onto ``ComposableArchitecture/PresentationAction``
        with a single case that holds onto `Destination.Action`.
        
        @Code(name: "ContactsFeatures.swift", file: 02-02-02-code-0008)
      }
      
      Now our model is more concisely defined, and we have compile time guarantees that only 
      one destination can be active at a time. But, also now have a lot of compiler errors we need
      to fix.
      
      @Step {
        Instead of populating a piece of `addContact` optional state in order to drive navigation
        to that feature, we will now mutate `destination` to point it to the `addContact` case.
        
        @Code(name: "ContactsFeatures.swift", file: 02-02-02-code-0009)
      }
      
      @Step {
        And when listening for actions happening in child domains we now need to destructure the
        `.destination(.presented(_))` case, such as when the "Add Contact" feature tells us to 
        save the contact.
        
        @Code(name: "ContactsFeatures.swift", file: 02-02-02-code-0010)
      }
      
      @Step {
        And when the alert confirms deletion of the contact.
        
        @Code(name: "ContactsFeatures.swift", file: 02-02-02-code-0011)
      }
      
      @Step {
        We can handle all other destination actions by simply returning a `.none` effect to 
        represent there is no other work to perform.
        
        @Code(name: "ContactsFeatures.swift", file: 02-02-02-code-0012)
      }
      
      @Step {
        Update the state mutation for showing an alert to instead point the `destination` to the
        `alert` case.
        
        @Code(name: "ContactsFeatures.swift", file: 02-02-02-code-0013)
      }
      
      @Step {
        Replace the two `ifLet`s that were used at the bottom of the reducer with a single one that
        runs the `Destination` reducer whenever the `destination` state is non-`nil`.
        
        @Code(name: "ContactsFeatures.swift", file: 02-02-02-code-0014)
      }
      
      That's all it takes to convert two independent, imprecisely modeled optional values into a 
      single optional enum, and we can now prove that only one destination can be active at a time.
      All that is left is to update the view so that we can specify which case of the destination
      enum drives the sheet and alert.
      
      @Step {
        There is an additional overload of `sheet(store:)` and `alert(store:)` that takes two extra
        arguments: a state transformation for extracting a particular case from the 
        `Destination.State` enum, and an action transformation for embedding a child action into
        a particular case of the `Destination.Action` enum.
        
        @Code(name: "ContactsFeatures.swift", file: 02-02-02-code-0015, previousFile: 02-02-02-code-0015-previous)
      }
      
      @Step {
        The state transformation is responsible for taking a piece of `Destination.State`, which
        is an enum, and extracting a particular case from it. We can do this by using a case path
        derived from the `addContact` case.
        
        @Code(name: "ContactsFeatures.swift", file: 02-02-02-code-0016)
      }
      
      @Step {
        The action transformation is responsible for taking a child action in the 
        `AddContactFeature` domain and embedding it into the `Destination.Action` enum. This can
        be done by using the case of the enum as a function.
        
        @Code(name: "ContactsFeatures.swift", file: 02-02-02-code-0017)
      }
      
      @Step {
        The same can be done for the `alert(store:)` view modifier.
        
        @Code(name: "ContactsFeatures.swift", file: 02-02-02-code-0018)
      }
      
      That completes the refactor of the reducer and view to use a single piece of optional enum
      state instead using multiple optional values. The application works exactly as it did before,
      but now its domain is more concisely modeled.
    }
  }
}
