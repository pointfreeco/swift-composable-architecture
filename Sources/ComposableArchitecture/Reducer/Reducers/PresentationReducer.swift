  /// For example, if a parent feature holds onto a piece of optional child state, then it can

  ///   }
  /// }
  /// ```
  ///
  /// The `ifLet` operator does a number of things to make integrating parent and child features
  /// ergonomic and enforce correctness:
  ///
  ///   * It forces a specific order of operations for the child and parent features:
  ///     * When a ``PresentationAction/dismiss`` action is sent, it runs the parent feature
  ///       before the child state is `nil`'d out. This gives the parent feature an opportunity to
  ///       inspect the child state one last time before the state is cleared.
  ///     * When a ``PresentationAction/presented(_:)`` action is sent it runs the
  ///       child first, and then the parent. If the order was reversed, then it would be possible
  ///       for the parent feature to `nil` out the child state, in which case the child feature
  ///       would not be able to react to that action. That can cause subtle bugs.
  ///
  ///   * It automatically cancels all child effects when it detects the child's state is `nil`'d
  ///     out.
  ///
  ///   * Automatically `nil`s out child state when an action is sent for alerts and confirmation
  ///     dialogs.
  ///
  ///   * It gives the child feature access to the ``DismissEffect`` dependency, which allows the
  ///     child feature to dismiss itself without communicating with the parent.
