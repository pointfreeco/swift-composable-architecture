# Voice Memos

This application demonstrates how to work with multiple dependencies and manage a complex state machine driven off of timers in the Composable Architecture. Some functionality includes:

* Requesting the userâ€™s permission to record audio.
* Prompting the user if insufficient permission is provided.
* Audio recording and playback.
* Handling errors that may occur during recording or playback.
* Stubbing dependencies to work with SwiftUI previews.
