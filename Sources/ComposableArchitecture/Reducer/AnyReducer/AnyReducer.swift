/// A reducer describes how to evolve the current state of an application to the next state, given
/// an action, and describes what ``Effect``s should be executed later by the store, if any.
///
/// Reducers have 3 generics:
///
///   * `State`: A type that holds the current state of the application.
///   * `Action`: A type that holds all possible actions that cause the state of the application to
///     change.
///   * `Environment`: A type that holds all dependencies needed in order to produce ``Effect``s,
///     such as API clients, analytics clients, random number generators, etc.
///
/// > Important: The thread on which effects output is important. An effect's output is immediately
///   sent back into the store, and ``Store`` is not thread safe. This means all effects must
///   receive values on the same thread, **and** if the ``Store`` is being used to drive UI then all
///   output must be on the main thread. You can use the `Publisher` method `receive(on:)` for make
///   the effect output its values on the thread of your choice.
/// >
/// > This is only an issue if using the Combine interface of ``Effect`` as mentioned above. If you
///   you are only using Swift's concurrency tools and the `.task`, `.run` and `.fireAndForget`
///   functions on ``Effect``, then the threading is automatically handled for you.

  ///
  /// It is important to note that the order of combining reducers matter. Combining `reducerA` with
  /// `reducerB` is not necessarily the same as combining `reducerB` with `reducerA`.
  ///
  /// This can become an issue when working with reducers that have overlapping domains. For
  /// example, if `reducerA` embeds the domain of `reducerB` and reacts to its actions or modifies
  /// its state, it can make a difference if `reducerA` chooses to modify `reducerB`'s state
  /// _before_ or _after_ `reducerB` runs.
  ///
  /// This is perhaps most easily seen when working with ``optional(file:fileID:line:)`` reducers,
  /// where the parent domain may listen to the child domain and `nil` out its state. If the parent
  /// reducer runs before the child reducer, then the child reducer will not be able to react to its
  /// own action.
  ///
  /// Similar can be said for a ``forEach(state:action:environment:file:fileID:line:)-2ypoa``
  /// reducer. If the parent domain modifies the child collection by moving, removing, or modifying
  /// an element before the `forEach` reducer runs, the `forEach` reducer may perform its action
  /// against the wrong element, an element that no longer exists, or an element in an unexpected
  /// state.
  ///
  /// Running a parent reducer before a child reducer can be considered an application logic
  /// error, and can produce assertion failures. So you should almost always combine reducers in
  /// order from child to parent domain.
  ///
  /// Here is an example of how you should combine an ``optional(file:fileID:line:)`` reducer with a
  /// parent domain:
  ///
  /// ```swift
  /// let parentReducer = AnyReducer<ParentState, ParentAction, ParentEnvironment>.combine(

  ///       ...

  ///       }
  ///     )
  ///     ```
  ///
  ///   * A child effect feeds a child action back into the store when child state is unavailable:
  ///
  ///     ```swift
  ///     let childReducer = Reducer<
  ///       ChildState, ChildAction, ChildEnvironment

  ///       },
  ///       // Before the child reducer runs
  ///       childReducer.optional().pullback(...)

  ///         // This action is never received here because child state is `nil` in the parent
  ///       ...
  ///     }
  ///     ```
  ///
  ///     To ensure that a child reducer can process any action that a parent may use to `nil` out
  ///     its state, combine it _before_ the parent:

  ///     ```swift

  ///       Reducer { state, action, environment in
  ///         ...
  ///       }
  ///     )
  ///     ```
  ///
  ///   * A child effect feeds a child action back into the store when child state is `nil`:
  ///
  ///     ```swift
  ///     let childReducer = Reducer<
  ///       ChildState, ChildAction, ChildEnvironment
  ///     > { state, action environment in

  ///     ```
  ///
  ///     It is perfectly reasonable to ignore the result of an effect when child state is `nil`,

          from state. This ensures that "forEach" reducers can handle their actions for the \
          element at the intended key.

          • An in-flight effect emitted this action while state contained no element at this \
          key. It may be perfectly reasonable to ignore this action, but you also may want to \
          cancel the effect it originated from when removing a value from the dictionary, \
          especially if it is a long-living effect.

          • This action was sent to the store while its state contained no element at this \
          key. To fix this make sure that actions for this reducer can only be sent to a view \
          store when its state contains an element at this key.
